// ===================== PUZZLE LIBRARY DATA =====================
// Backing data for the Puzzles tab's category library (see PUZZLE_CATEGORIES and
// renderPuzzleCategory in the main file). Split into its own file the same way loot-data.js is —
// this is pure content, no logic, loaded via a plain <script src> before the main file's own
// script block runs.
//
// Two shapes in use:
//   Riddles:            { q: "riddle text", a: "answer", tier: "easy"|"medium"|"hard"|"legendary", hook: "in-dungeon stake" }
//   Everything else:    { title: "Short Name", prompt: "read-aloud text", solution: "answer + reasoning", note: "DM mechanical hook" }
//
// `hook` (added in the action/event rework pass) is what actually attaches a riddle to something
// happening at the table instead of a pure verbal Q&A — a guardian to fight, something to break
// open, something to search for, or a payoff to loot. Deliberately short (it's a DM prompt to
// riff on, not a script) and deliberately varied in WHICH kind of action it calls for, so 51
// riddles in a row don't all resolve as "a monster attacks on a wrong answer."

// Reworked from the original 18-riddle library, which was almost entirely the same rigid
// "I [verb clause]... What am I?" template — genuinely monotonous, and a few had answers that
// weren't fairly inferable from their own clues. Replaced with four difficulty tiers and mixed
// formats (rhyming couplets, straight wordplay, classic "I am" riddles).
//
// A later pass ("A sphinx blocks your path and asks: ...", "A cartographer's riddle, scrawled
// in the margin of an old map: ...") wrapped many of these in narrator/NPC scene-setting around
// the actual question, plus redundant trailing tags ("What is the answer?" after a riddle that
// already ends in its own question). Stripped back out here so `q` holds only the riddle itself
// — a few (e.g. "Three sisters live in the same house...") were left untouched since the
// scenario itself IS the riddle, not a wrapper around one, and a couple of now-orphaned pronouns
// ("What is she talking about?" with "she" removed) were tightened to stay self-contained. This
// is about riddle content specifically — read-aloud "prompt" text on every OTHER puzzle category
// below is a different field for a different purpose and is untouched.

What am I?', a: 'Smoke', tier: 'hard', hook: 'Following actual smoke to its source (after answering) leads straight to a hidden forge room and the smith-guardian defending it — a real, scaled encounter, not a bluff.' },

What am I?', a: 'Sleep (or: a clock/time)', tier: 'hard', hook: 'A sleeping guardian only stays dormant while the riddle goes unanswered wrong — a bad guess spoken aloud rouses it for a real, if brief, fight before it settles back down.' },
  { q: 'What can be given, but never actually bought, and once broken, is nearly impossible to fully repair?', a: 'Trust', tier: 'hard', hook: 'An NPC ally will only hand over a genuinely useful item (a map, a key, a favor) after the riddle is answered in front of them — it\'s framed as a test of whether the party is worth trusting.' },
  { q: 'I have no beginning and no end, yet I contain every edge, every corner, and every point in between. What am I?', a: 'A circle', tier: 'hard', hook: 'A circular vault door has no visible seam; answering correctly reveals where to strike it (one solid hit, no roll needed) to pop it open along its hidden edge.' },
  // ---- LEGENDARY ----
  { q: 'Name the only thing that grows larger the more it is shared, yet costs the giver nothing at all to give away.

Reward any answer the player can genuinely justify.)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'An ancient sphinx guardian tests the party before allowing passage into its hoard — a genuine, justified answer opens the vault; a hollow or cynical one provokes it to attack with its full statblock.' },

What — or who — am I?', a: 'Time', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A crumbling hourglass-golem attacks the instant it finishes its own countdown; answering before the sand runs out (a few real rounds) stops it cold and lets the party loot its core.' },
  { q: 'I am told a thousand different ways by a thousand different mouths, and no two tellings are ever quite the same, yet I am still called by one single name. What am I?', a: 'A legend (or: a myth/story)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A ghostly bard will only reveal the location of a buried hoard tied to its own legend once answered correctly — refuse or fail and it simply fades, taking the secret with it for good.' },
  { q: 'Kill me and you gain nothing. Feed me and I will consume you both. Ignore me, and I fade to nothing on my own. What am I, three times over?', a: 'A grudge (or: a feud/hatred — the "three times" hints that the same answer must fit "kill," "feed," and "ignore")', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'Two feuding spirits will only stop attacking each other (and any party member caught between them) once the riddle is answered aloud to both at once, breaking the cycle.' },

What am I?', a: 'A lie (or: a rumor)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A corrupted court record room is guarded by an animated ledger that attacks anything false spoken near it; the correct answer, spoken plainly, causes it to lie still and be safely looted.' },
  { q: 'I crowned a thousand kings and buried just as many. Armies have marched in my name, yet I have never once lifted a blade myself. What am I?', a: 'War', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A war-monument golem will not stand down until answered, and attacks with a full statblock if the riddle is refused outright — a real, dangerous fight, not a bluff.' },
  { q: 'What can you give away completely, and still keep every last piece of it for yourself?', a: 'A promise (your word — giving it away means honoring it, not losing it)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'An oathbound guardian will only lower its weapon and open its vault once a party member both answers correctly and speaks a genuine promise aloud — breaking that promise later has real, DM-tracked consequences.' },
  { q: 'I am heavier than the mountain the moment you try to set me down, yet weightless the instant you choose to carry me freely. What am I?', a: 'A burden (or a duty/responsibility — the riddle is about willingness, not literal weight)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A crushing-weight trap engages on anyone who tries to force the door; answering correctly and stepping through willingly bypasses it entirely, no roll needed.' },
  { q: 'Name the one thing every mortal is certain to lose, that no army, no spell, and no amount of gold has ever once been able to buy back. What is it?', a: 'Youth', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'An ageless, withered guardian offers its hoard freely to anyone who answers correctly, and attacks anyone who tries to simply take it by force instead.' },
  { q: 'I touch every single thing that has ever existed, yet I myself can never be touched, held, or truly seen. I have no mouth, and yet I am the reason anything can be heard at all. What am I?', a: 'Air (the wind itself)', tier: 'legendary', hook: 'A howling wind-elemental blocks the final passage, and only stops screaming long enough to be answered if the party first destroys the three wind-chimes stoking it (any weapon, one hit each).' }

  {
    title: "The Twin Golems",
    prompt: "Two identical stone golems flank a locked gate, one carved with a sun and one with a moon. A plaque reads: 'One of us always tells the truth. One of us always lies. You may ask exactly one question, to only one of us, before the gate judges you.' The golems answer any question, not just yes/no ones.",
    solution: "Ask either golem: 'What would the other golem say is the way through?' and then take the OPPOSITE of whatever answer you get. The truthful golem accurately reports the liar's false answer; the lying golem falsely reports the truthful golem's real answer — either way, the answer given is always wrong, so its opposite is always correct.",
    note: "No roll needed if a player works out the logic themselves; Intelligence DC 13 as a hint if the party is stuck after real effort. Asking a bad question (or none at all) animates the golem that was addressed, which takes one real swing (1d8 bludgeoning) before going still again for a retry. Reward: passage, plus a small satchel of coin left by past supplicants at the golems' feet, worth looting."
  },
  {
    title: "The Scale of Five",
    prompt: "A vault door sits behind a balance scale and five identical-looking iron ingots on a nearby table. A plaque reads: 'One ingot is lighter than the rest. Two weighings, no more, will find it.'",
    solution: "Weigh two ingots against two others, leaving one aside. If they balance, the set-aside ingot is the light one. If they don't balance, take the lighter pair from that weighing and weigh those two against each other — the lighter of the two is the culprit.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12 as a hint if the party is fumbling toward a solution but hasn't quite found the two-weighing trick. A third weighing overloads the scale — it collapses loudly enough to draw a wandering patrol (roll a random encounter) and the vault seals for 10 minutes before it can be tried again. Reward: the vault's contents, plus the light ingot itself turns out to be hollow, stuffed with a note pointing to a second cache."
  },
  {
    title: "The River Crossing",
    prompt: "A narrow, swift river blocks the path. A single small raft is tied to the bank, only able to carry the party's guide plus one other creature at a time. The guide is ferrying three creatures across for a local farmer: a wolf, a goat, and a sack of cabbages. Left alone together unsupervised, the wolf will eat the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbages.",
    solution: "Take the goat across first (leaving wolf and cabbage, which are safe together). Return alone, take the wolf across, but bring the goat back with you. Leave the goat, take the cabbages across (leaving wolf and cabbage safe together). Return alone for the goat, and bring it across last.",
    note: "No roll needed for a party that works it out themselves; Intelligence DC 11 as a hint after a couple of failed attempts. A wrong sequence spooks the goat loose entirely — it bolts, and someone must actually run it down (a contested Dexterity/Athletics check) before the crossing can restart. Reward: safe passage plus real coin from the grateful farmer, and a spare bedroll he presses on the party for the trouble."
  },
  {
    title: "The Locked Diary",
    prompt: "A dead scholar's diary is locked with a simple three-digit combination. Scrawled on the inside cover: 'The first digit is triple the last. The middle digit is the first digit minus the last digit. All three digits add up to 12.' ",
    solution: "Let the last digit be x, so the first is 3x. The middle digit is 3x − x = 2x. Sum: 3x + 2x + x = 6x = 12, so x = 2. First digit = 6, middle = 4, last = 2. The combination is 642.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13 to set up the algebra cleanly if the party is doing this by trial and error rather than equations — let them brute-force it with enough patience instead if they'd rather not do math at the table. Three wrong combinations trips a needle hidden in the clasp (DC 12 Dexterity save or 1 piercing damage plus a minor poison — nothing lethal). Reward: the diary holds a hand-drawn map fragment worth finding and following up on."
  },
  {
    title: "The Four Suspects",
    prompt: "A theft has occurred, and four suspects each make one statement. Aldric says: 'Bryn did it.' Bryn says: 'Corin did it.' Corin says: 'Bryn is lying.' Dessa says: 'I didn't do it.' Exactly one suspect is telling the truth, and that suspect is the thief.",
    solution: "If Aldric is the truthful thief, then Bryn did it AND Aldric did it — a contradiction (only one person can be the thief), so Aldric is lying. If Bryn is the truthful thief, then Corin did it AND Bryn did it — also a contradiction, so Bryn is lying, which means Corin's statement ('Bryn is lying') is true, and Corin is the thief. Checking: Corin is the truthful one, saying 'Bryn is lying' — which fits, since we already know Bryn lied. Corin is the thief.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 13 to work through the logic cleanly, or let the party reason it out verbally at the table without a formal roll. A wrong accusation lets the real thief bolt for the door — catching them now means a short chase or a brief scuffle (a weak, non-lethal combat) rather than a clean arrest. Reward: catching Corin recovers the stolen goods outright, a real loot payoff, plus whatever bounty or goodwill follows."
  },
  {
    title: "The Nine Cells",
    prompt: "A dungeon's holding block has nine cells in a 3x3 grid, each meant to hold exactly one prisoner. A guard's log states: 'Row and column each must sum to the same total.' Numbers 1 through 9, each used exactly once, are carved above the cell doors, but three are missing and must be filled in by the party based on the rule to unlock the block's master gate.",
    solution: "This is a 3x3 magic square. The numbers 1–9 arranged so every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15 form the unique (up to rotation/reflection) arrangement: 8 1 6 / 3 5 7 / 4 9 2. Whatever three numbers are missing from the DM's specific version of the grid, they're the ones that complete this pattern in their given positions.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14, or let a player who enjoys number puzzles work it out directly — the magic square's total (15) can be given as a freebie hint (row 2 or the carved plaque states it) if the table is stuck. A wrong number placement trips the block's alarm wards, animating 1-2 guard constructs the party must fight off before trying again. Reward: the master gate unlocks a real treasure cache alongside whatever prisoner or evidence the block was holding."
  },
  {
    title: "The Weighted Chest",
    prompt: "Three identical chests sit in a row, each holding a different amount of gold: one holds nothing, one holds a middling amount, and one holds a small fortune. Labels on the chests are known to be ALL incorrect: 'Empty,' 'Some Gold,' and 'Full of Gold.' The party may open exactly one chest to figure out all three.",
    solution: "Open the chest labeled 'Some Gold' — since the labels are all wrong, this chest cannot hold some gold; it must hold either nothing or a fortune. Whichever it actually holds tells you the rest: if it's empty, then the chest labeled 'Full of Gold' (which can't be full, and can't be empty since we just found the empty one) must hold Some Gold, leaving the chest labeled 'Empty' to hold the fortune. If the 'Some Gold' chest is actually full, then the 'Empty' chest must hold Some Gold, and the 'Full' chest holds nothing.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 13 to reason through which single chest to open for guaranteed full information — this is meant to reward clean logical thinking, not guessing. Opening a chest out of order still works but wakes a small warded guardian coiled beneath the labels (a single weak attack, then it subsides). Reward: full access to loot all three chests' contents once solved — gold, mid-tier valuables, and the fortune itself."
  },
  {
    title: "The Bridge of Torches",
    prompt: "Four adventurers must cross a rickety rope bridge in pitch darkness, but only one torch remains, and the bridge can hold at most two people at once. Aldo crosses in 1 minute, Bree in 2, Corin in 5, and Dagny in 10. The torch must be carried both ways, and the party has 17 minutes before it burns out.",
    solution: "Send Aldo and Bree across first (2 minutes). Aldo returns with the torch (1 minute, total 3). Send Corin and Dagny across together (10 minutes, total 13). Bree returns with the torch (2 minutes, total 15). Finally, Aldo and Bree cross together again (2 minutes, total 17) — everyone makes it exactly as the torch gutters out.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 14 to work out that the two slowest travelers should cross together rather than separately, which is the key insight. A slower solution means the torch gutters out with someone still on the bridge — a real predator in the dark below lunges at whoever's stuck there (one attack, then it retreats) unless they make a DC 12 Dexterity save to finish crossing blind first. Reward: safe passage, plus a hidden cache lashed beneath the bridge's far anchor, worth a quick search to find."
  },
  {
    title: "The Three Chests of Fate",
    prompt: "A wizard's testing chamber holds three chests. A sign reads: 'Exactly one chest is safe to open. The gold chest's plaque says: I am safe. The silver chest's plaque says: The gold chest is not safe. The bronze chest's plaque says: I am not safe.' Exactly one of the three plaques is telling the truth.",
    solution: "If the gold plaque is true, then gold is safe — but then the silver plaque ('gold is not safe') would be false, and the bronze plaque ('I am not safe') would also need to be false, meaning bronze IS safe, contradicting 'exactly one is safe.' If the silver plaque is true (gold is not safe), the gold plaque is false (consistent), and the bronze plaque must be false, meaning bronze IS safe — but then two chests (silver's claim and bronze itself) would need checking: silver merely claims gold isn't safe, it doesn't claim itself is safe, so silver being true doesn't make silver the safe one. Testing bronze as the safe chest with silver's statement true holds up consistently. The bronze chest is safe to open.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 15 — this is one of the harder logic puzzles in the set, expect the table to talk it through together rather than one player solving it alone. Opening a wrong chest triggers a real, if minor, ward-burst (DC 13 Dexterity save or 1d6 force damage). Reward: the bronze chest holds genuine loot fit for a wizard's testing chamber — a scroll, a wand, or a pouch of rare spell components."
  },
  {
    title: "The Seven Locks",
    prompt: "A vault door has seven numbered dial-locks in a row, each currently showing a number from 1 to 7 with no two dials repeating a number, but scrambled from their correct order. A plaque states: 'Swap any two dials in one move. Three moves will set them right, if you choose wisely — the correct order is written nowhere, but each dial that IS already correctly placed will glow faintly.'",
    solution: "This is a minimum-swaps puzzle: identify the dials that already glow (correctly placed) and leave them alone. For the remaining out-of-place dials, trace the cycles they form (dial A's number belongs where dial B is, and B's number belongs where C is, etc.) — a cycle of length n can always be fixed in n−1 swaps. With careful tracing, any specific scrambled arrangement of up to 7 elements with at most 2-3 misplaced short cycles can be resolved in 3 moves or fewer.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14 to correctly trace which dials are glowing versus misplaced and plan the swap sequence. Exceeding three swaps seals the vault and animates a guardian construct set to test intruders in melee — beat it down (or drive it off) to earn a second attempt at the dials. Reward: the vault's contents, a genuine treasure haul, once solved."

    title: "The Poisoned Cups",
    prompt: "Ten identical cups of wine sit on a table, and the party knows exactly one is poisoned — slow-acting enough that a taste-tester wouldn't show symptoms for a full hour. Trapped in the room, the party has one hour before a door seals permanently, and they have exactly four rats willing to taste-test (a gift from a druid ally, sacrificed to the cause).",
    solution: "Number the cups 1 through 10 in binary using the four rats as binary digits (each rat represents one bit). For each cup, have a specific combination of rats taste a small sample based on that cup's binary representation (e.g., cup 6 = binary 0110, so rats 2 and 3 taste it). After an hour, whichever combination of rats shows symptoms directly identifies the poisoned cup's number in binary. Four rats can distinguish up to 16 possibilities, more than enough for 10 cups.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) DC 15 — this is a genuinely tricky puzzle, and it's fair to let a player with an unusual background (alchemist, tinkerer, spy) approach it with advantage, or to simply explain the binary-tasting trick via an NPC advisor if the table is unfamiliar with binary counting. Running out of rats or time before narrowing it down forces an actual party member to taste-test under the clock — a real, if survivable, poison save. Reward: identifying the poisoned cup safely lets the party loot and drink the other nine worry-free, or bottle the poison itself as a usable item against a later foe."

    title: "The Order of Precedence",
    prompt: "Five knights — Aldric, Bea, Cato, Dree, and Elric — must be seated at a ceremonial table in the correct order of seniority, but the only clues available are overheard fragments: 'Bea is senior to Cato, but junior to Aldric.' 'Dree is the most junior of all five.' 'Elric is senior to Aldric.'",
    solution: "From the clues: Elric > Aldric > Bea > Cato, and Dree is last (most junior). The full seniority order, most senior to least: Elric, Aldric, Bea, Cato, Dree.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 12 to chain the clues together correctly — this is meant to be one of the easier logic puzzles, solvable through careful reading rather than complex deduction. Seating someone out of order genuinely offends the wronged knight, who challenges the seater to a quick, non-lethal duel of honor right there at the table (a short, low-stakes combat). Reward: proper seating earns the order's real gratitude — a knight's token the party can spend later as a favor, or straight coin."

    title: "The Counterfeit Coin",
    prompt: "Among twelve identical-looking gold coins, exactly one is counterfeit and weighs either slightly more or slightly less than the rest (the party doesn't know which). A simple balance scale is available, and the vault mechanism will only respond to exactly three weighings.",
    solution: "Divide the coins into three groups of four. Weigh group A against group B. If they balance, the counterfeit is in group C — weigh two of those against each other (with a known-good coin as the third if needed) to narrow it down in two more weighings. If A and B don't balance, the counterfeit is in the heavier or lighter group; take that group and split it further, using the remaining weighings to isolate the exact coin and whether it's heavy or light. (A full worked solution takes real table time — let the party talk it through, and consider providing a physical prop or notes to track groupings.)",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15 — this is the hardest logic puzzle in the set and can genuinely take a while to reason through even for real puzzle-solvers; be patient and let the party use paper/notes to track their weighings. Exceeding three weighings dumps the entire coin pile onto the floor in a clatter, requiring a quick search (Investigation) to re-sort them before trying again. Reward: identifying the counterfeit unlocks the vault's real gold haul, and the counterfeit itself is worth keeping as a curious, sellable trinket — plus a corrupt local mint as a story hook if you want to use it."

    title: "The Four Sealed Doors",
    prompt: "Four numbered doors stand before the party, and one — only one — is safe to open. Three ghostly attendants, bound to guide (or mislead) visitors, offer testimony. The first says: 'The safe door's number is even.' The second says: 'The safe door is not Door 4.' The third says: 'The safe door's number is greater than 2.' Exactly one of the three attendants is telling the truth; the other two are lying.",
    solution: "Test each door as the safe one and count how many attendants would be telling the truth. Door 1 safe: 'even' is false, 'not Door 4' is true, 'greater than 2' is false — exactly one truth. Door 2 safe: 'even' true, 'not Door 4' true, 'greater than 2' false — two truths, doesn't fit. Door 3 safe: 'even' false, 'not Door 4' true, 'greater than 2' true — two truths, doesn't fit. Door 4 safe: 'even' true, 'not Door 4' false, 'greater than 2' true — two truths, doesn't fit. Only Door 1 produces exactly one true statement among the three attendants, so Door 1 is the safe door.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 14 to work through the four possibilities systematically — encourage the party to test each door in turn against all three statements rather than guessing. A wrong door releases a real, if weak, guardian creature (scale it down for a quick fight) rather than just an alarm, and the party can eliminate that door and retry with the remaining three once it's dealt with. Reward: real loot behind Door 1, worth the careful logic."

    title: "The Merchant's Fair Trade",
    prompt: "A puzzle-loving merchant offers a deal: three sealed bags each contain a different number of gems (5, 8, and 13, though the party doesn't know which bag holds which). The merchant states: 'The middle bag does not hold 13. The left bag does not hold 8. The bag on the left holds fewer gems than the bag beside it.'",
    solution: "The middle bag can't hold 13, and the left bag can't hold 8 — so the left bag must hold either 5 or 13, but it can't be 13 either (that's ruled out for the middle bag, not the left one, so check the third clue: the left bag holds FEWER gems than the middle bag). If left held 13, it couldn't hold fewer than whatever's in the middle, since 13 is the largest value available — so left must hold 5. That leaves 8 and 13 for middle and right; since the middle bag can't hold 13, middle holds 8, and right holds 13.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 12 to work through the three clues methodically in order — this is meant to be a mid-tier constraint puzzle, more approachable than the counterfeit coin or sealed doors above. Guessing wrong costs a real, if small, wager the merchant insists on before resetting the bags (a handful of gold). Reward: the correctly identified 13-gem bag is real, sellable loot, plus the merchant's respect and a standing discount on future trades."

    title: "The Prisoners' Hats",
    prompt: "Three prisoners are seated in a row, each wearing a hat that is either black or white, unable to see their own hat but able to see the hats of the prisoners seated in front of them. The rearmost prisoner can see both others' hats; the middle prisoner can see only the front prisoner's; the front prisoner can see no one's. A guard explains the rules before hooding them and placing the hats: 'There are exactly three hats between you — two black, one white — and every one of them is being used right now. If any of you can prove the color of your own hat, all three go free.' The rearmost prisoner speaks up immediately.",
    solution: "Since all three hats (two black, one white) are guaranteed to be in use across exactly three prisoners, the rearmost prisoner — who can see both other hats — always has enough information to deduce their own with certainty. If they see two black hats on the others, the only hat left is white, so theirs must be white. If they see one black and one white hat on the others, the only hat left from the supply (one black, one white already accounted for) is the second black hat, so theirs must be black. Either way, the rearmost prisoner can always solve it on the spot — they don't need to wait and see if the others struggle first.",
    note: "Intelligence DC 12 once the party grasps that ALL three hats from the fixed 2-black-1-white supply are in play (make sure the guard's dialogue states this plainly — it's the one piece of information the whole puzzle depends on). A wrong answer costs the guessing prisoner one more night in the cell (no immediate harm, but time pressure if the party's on a clock) before another guess is allowed. Reward: all three prisoners go free and, grateful, point the party toward a stash of confiscated gear the guards never bothered to log — worth finding and looting on the way out."

    title: "The Alchemist's Ratios",
    prompt: "An alchemist's recipe book, partially burned, gives a potion formula: 'Two parts moonwort to three parts nightshade makes a sleeping draught. Reverse the ratio, and you have a deadly poison instead. The cauldron holds exactly ten measures total, no more, no less.' The party needs the sleeping draught, not the poison.",
    solution: "The ratio 2:3 (moonwort:nightshade) must scale to fill exactly 10 measures. Since 2+3 = 5 parts total, scaling by 2 gives 4 parts moonwort and 6 parts nightshade, totaling 10 — the correct sleeping draught mixture is 4 measures moonwort, 6 measures nightshade.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) DC 11 — a straightforward ratio-scaling puzzle, on the easier end of this set. Mixing the reversed ratio (6 moonwort, 4 nightshade) actually brews the deadly poison instead, and it fumes — anyone leaning over the cauldron when it finishes needs a DC 12 Constitution save or take 1d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. Reward: a real, working sleeping draught (a usable potion) brewed correctly from salvaged ingredients, plus leftover nightshade worth bottling as a separate poison if the ratio was reversed on purpose."

    title: "The Watchtower Signals",
    prompt: "Three watchtowers along a border each show one of three signal-flag colors (red, blue, or gold) at any given time, and the party needs to know what the colors mean to interpret an incoming warning. A retired signal officer NPC gives cryptic hints: 'Red never means safe. If Tower One shows gold, Tower Two never shows red. Tower Three's color always matches Tower One's, unless Tower One shows blue.'",
    solution: "This puzzle is meant to be solved through direct observation combined with the given rules rather than pure abstract logic — have the party actually watch the towers' current colors and cross-reference against the officer's rules to determine what's currently being signaled (e.g., if Tower One shows gold, Tower Two can't show red, narrowing what Tower Two's color must mean; if Tower Three matches Tower One, that confirms Tower One's signal is being relayed rather than an independent one). The DM should decide the towers' actual current colors and what the overall message is (danger approaching, all clear, reinforcements needed) and use the officer's rules as the lens the party uses to interpret it correctly.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12, or simply good roleplay engagement with the retired officer NPC, who can clarify a rule if directly asked a good follow-up question. A wrong interpretation walks the party straight into whatever the towers were actually warning about — a real, scaled ambush rather than a pacing complication. Reward: correctly reading the towers gives the party a head start, letting them strike first or loot the ambush site the enemy abandoned in retreat."

    title: "The Broken Sundial Clock",
    prompt: "A mechanism requires the party to input the current 'hour' using a set of five numbered gears, each showing 0-9, but three of the gears are jammed and must be deduced from a mechanic's note: 'The sum of all five gears is 27. The first and last gears are equal. The middle gear is double the second gear. The fourth gear is one more than the middle gear.'",
    solution: "Let the first and last gears both equal a, the second gear equal b, so the middle (third) gear is 2b, and the fourth gear is 2b+1. Sum: a + b + 2b + (2b+1) + a = 27, which simplifies to 2a + 5b + 1 = 27, so 2a + 5b = 26. Testing small values: if b=2, then 2a=16, a=8. Checking: gears are 8, 2, 4, 5, 8 — sum is 8+2+4+5+8=27. This fits all constraints.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14 for the algebra, or let the party brute-force small values of b (0 through 5, since 5×5=25 already exceeds available room) with pencil and paper until one fits cleanly. A wrong gear setting jams the works and swings out a mechanical arm — a quick DC 12 Dexterity save or take 1d4 bludgeoning — before it resets for another attempt. Reward: a hidden compartment behind the dial pops open once solved, holding a genuine cache of loot."

    title: "The Six Guards' Shifts",
    prompt: "Six guards rotate shifts at a checkpoint the party needs to slip past unnoticed, and an old duty roster (partially legible) gives clues: 'Guard Corvin never works alongside Guard Delphine. Guard Aeliana always works the shift right before Guard Brannon. Exactly two guards are on duty at any given time, and there are three shifts per day.' The party needs to determine which shift has the weakest (most exploitable) pairing.",
    solution: "This puzzle is meant to be worked out through logical elimination combined with whatever additional guard-personality details the DM provides (a lazy guard, a distracted one, a pair known to argue) — use the roster constraints to narrow down which two guards are paired on which shift, then apply narrative judgment (which the party can gather through observation or a bribed informant) to identify the shift with the least vigilant or most distracted pairing. The 'never alongside' and 'always right before' clues are enough to fully determine the roster's structure once the DM fixes the actual guard names to real shift slots ahead of time.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13, or a full session of in-fiction stakeout/observation (several Perception checks over a longer watch) as a fair alternative to pure logic-puzzle solving. Choosing the wrong shift and getting caught means a real, if manageable, fight with the alert pairing rather than just a harder Stealth check. Reward: successfully identifying and exploiting the weak shift lets the party slip past unnoticed AND loot whatever the checkpoint guards were skimming for themselves."

No digit repeats within a code. The code for the record you seek is the largest possible three-digit number using only the digits 2, 5, and 8, where the digits are arranged so that no digit is in its 'natural' ascending position (2 first, 5 second, 8 last).'",
    solution: "This is a derangement problem: the three digits are 2, 5, 8, and 'natural order' is 2-5-8. We need the largest possible number where NO digit sits in its natural position (2 is not first, 5 is not second, 8 is not last). Testing arrangements: 8-2-5 has 8 first (not natural for 8, good), 2 second (not natural for 2, good), 5 third (not natural for 5, good) — this is a valid full derangement, and among the valid derangements (8-2-5 and 5-8-2), 852 is the larger number.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13 to work through the derangement logic, or let the party simply try all six possible arrangements of three digits by hand (a manageable brute force at this scale) and check each against the two rules. Three wrong codes lock the drawer's release, forcing the party to find and physically break a secondary latch (DC 13 Strength) to retry.

Tucked inside the coat of a cartographer's corpse the party passed earlier lies a torn journal page headed 'Irongate Cipher — solved at last,' showing a full substitution alphabet she'd worked out before she died: A→I, B→R, C→O, D→N, E→G, F→A, G→T, H→E, I→B, J→C, K→D, L→F, M→H, N→J, O→K, P→L, Q→M, R→P, S→Q, T→S, U→U, V→V, W→W, X→X, Y→Y, Z→Z. Using her key, what does the lintel say?",
    solution: "It reads THE VAULT WAKES AT DAWN — the gate only unseals itself at first light, not on command. The cipher alphabet is built from the keyword IRONGATE (its unique letters, I-R-O-N-G-A-T-E, followed by the rest of the alphabet in order), which is why the cartographer titled her notes after the fortress. Translating the lintel doesn't open the gate; it tells the party WHEN it opens, so they don't waste the night trying to force it at the wrong hour.",
    note: "The key is a free prop (no check to find it); DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) if a player wants to verify the substitution pattern instead of trusting the journal outright. A wrong translation just means they sit at a locked gate at the wrong hour, possibly drawing a wandering encounter — no trap.

Beneath the carving, a line has been scratched into the stone: INL FY IZXP. Every letter has plainly been pushed forward through the alphabet by some number of places, and the shrine itself seems to be telling them how many.",
    solution: "Shift each letter back by 5 (I→D, N→I, L→G, and so on) to get DIG AT DUSK. The shrine marks a grave, and it's telling whoever reads it when the ground here is soft and unwatched enough to dig safely. The five carved bells are the shift key: each ciphertext letter has been pushed 5 places forward, so decoding means shifting every letter back by 5.",
    note: "DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) hint: note aloud that the number of bells matches something countable about the cipher. No real fail-state — digging at the wrong hour just means the ground is frozen, watched, or already disturbed (a complication, not damage).

A worn plaque nearby spells the trick out for anyone who reads closely: the twin saints' alphabet runs backward — A is Z, B is Y, and so on to the mirror's end.",
    solution: "This is an Atbash cipher (A↔Z, B↔Y, C↔X, and so on). Reversing the mirror-mapping gives THE BELL IS THE KEY. If there's a bell prop nearby (or you place one in the next room), this line confirms to the players that ringing it is the intended solution, not a trap.",
    note: "DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) hint: the statues literally mirror each other, which is the whole trick. Trying a normal shift cipher instead just produces gibberish — no penalty beyond wasted time, since the floor tiles aren't trapped.

A groundskeeper mutters that the old verse-carvers 'always hid something in the first letters, if you knew to look.'",

An acolyte insists the hymn is sung backward at the midnight service — 'end to end, not front to front' — though she can't say why.",

The hymn is a direction marker disguised as scripture — whatever the vigil is meant to protect lies to the north of the temple, and the acolyte's odd 'backward' singing tradition is a folk memory of how the cipher is meant to be read.",

    prompt: "A dead cartographer's dungeon-survey map marks eight named chambers strung along a single main tunnel, in order: Duskhollow, Ironvein, Gravedeep, Nightcairn, Oreshaft, Ravengate, Tombwell, Hollowmere. In the margin, someone has written in a different hand: 'Read the stone, not the names.'",
    solution: "Taking the first letter of each chamber in order — D, I, G, N, O, R, T, H — spells DIG NORTH. The map is telling whoever reads it that the real way forward isn't through the marked tunnel at all, but by breaking straight through the north wall of one specific chamber.",
    note: "DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice the marginal note is a deliberate hint rather than an old owner's doodle. Following the marked tunnel instead of digging costs real time and risks a wandering encounter along the longer route. Reward: digging north (DC 13 Strength, or the right tool) breaks straight into a sealed side-chamber holding whatever the cartographer was really mapping — a genuine treasure cache."

    title: "The Smuggler's Waypoints",
    prompt: "Deep in a smugglers' cave hideout, a hand-drawn route map is pinned to a support beam, marking four named chambers along the tunnel ahead, each name written unusually large and blocky, as if size mattered: Hollow, Ashenvalleys, Rowen, Marsh. A torn corner of the map bears a single instruction: 'Count the letters, not the miles.'",
    solution: "Counting the letters in each chamber name and converting each count to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, and so on) gives: Hollow = 6 letters = F, Ashenvalleys = 12 letters = L, Rowen = 5 letters = E, Marsh = 5 letters = E. Together: FLEE. The map is a warning left by the smugglers themselves — whatever's in the Marsh chamber is what drove them out.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) hint: point out the odd, deliberate lettering size, as if inviting the reader to count. Missing the warning and pressing on toward Marsh anyway walks the party straight into whatever spooked the smugglers off — a real, scaled encounter waiting in that chamber. Reward: heeding FLEE in time lets the party quietly loot the smugglers' abandoned cache on the way out instead."

    title: "The Sacred Vowels",
    prompt: "If your campaign already has an established written language, rune set, or conlang, reskin this puzzle entirely using that instead — the mechanic below is just a simple, swappable stand-in. As written: a shrine's inner wall is carved with a script where consonants look like ordinary letters, but the five vowels have been replaced with small sacred glyphs, each named for an element by the temple's own scripture (found earlier, or paraphrased now): Flame stands for A, Wave for E, Stone for I, Wind for O, Root for U. The carving reads (with the glyphs described aloud or drawn as symbols): 'TH[Wave] V[Wind][Stone]D [Wind]P[Wave]NS [Flame]T D[Root]SK.'",
    solution: "Substituting each named glyph back for its vowel gives THE VOID OPENS AT DUSK. It's a warning inscription rather than a passphrase — whatever door, portal, or seal this shrine guards is only vulnerable (or only opens, depending on your framing) around dusk, and the party should plan their approach accordingly.",
    note: "DC 10 Religion or Arcana to recall the elemental-vowel scripture if it's been established in-world, or DC 13 Investigation to work out the pattern cold from context (short, common words like 'the' and 'at' are the easiest giveaways). No trap for a wrong reading — just a wasted trip if they show up at the wrong hour. Reward: showing up prepared at dusk avoids whatever complication the void's opening would otherwise cause."

(4) Keep the silence, speak his name. (5) Trust the light to lead you home. (6) Never fear the endless dark. Pressed between the pages is a scrap of paper reading only: '3-3, 2-5, 3-6, 6-5.'",
    solution: "Each pair is (line number, word number). Line 3, word 3 = 'vault.' Line 2, word 5 = 'flame.' Line 3, word 6 = 'stone.' Line 6, word 5 = 'dark.' Together: VAULT FLAME STONE DARK — a description of where to look (a vault, near a flame fixture, behind or under a stone marker, somewhere dark) rather than a spoken passphrase.",
    note: "DC 11 Intelligence (Investigation) to realize the numbers reference the hymnal's own lines and words rather than being a random code. A miscounted word (easy off-by-one) just gives a slightly wrong or nonsensical clue word — let the party sanity-check against the room before committing to a wrong location.

Elsewhere in the estate, a letter in the family strongbox is written entirely in gibberish: 'TZL BGUEK YEELMTLR.' A note clipped to it reads: 'Sealed by the old way — the ring tells you how.'",
    solution: "This is a Vigenère cipher using the keyword ASH. Repeating A-S-H across the ciphertext and subtracting each key letter's value from the corresponding ciphertext letter decodes it to THE BONES REMEMBER — a family motto or warning tied to an ancestor's crypt, curse, or debt. (Decoding: T-A=T, Z-S=H, L-H=E for 'THE'; and so on through BGUEK→BONES and YEELMTLR→REMEMBER.)",
    note: "This is the most math-heavy entry in the set — DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation), or let a player with a relevant background (scholar, spy, cipher-clerk) attempt it with advantage, or simply hand over a decode table if your table doesn't enjoy the arithmetic.

In the desk's single locked drawer (picked open or found unlocked), a note reads: '18-5-4 / 4-15-15-18 / 14-15-18-20-8.'",
    solution: "Using the plaque's chart, each number converts directly to a letter: 18-5-4 = R-E-D, 4-15-15-18 = D-O-O-R, 14-15-18-20-8 = N-O-R-T-H. Together: RED DOOR NORTH — directions to a specific door, painted or marked red, somewhere north of the scholar's study.",
    note: "DC 8 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice the plaque is a working key rather than décor. A slipped digit (reading 15 as 1-5 instead of one number) is an easy, forgivable player error — let them recheck rather than punish it. Reward: whatever's behind the red door — this format works well as a simple 'X marks the spot' clue rather than a guarded secret."

Nothing about it seems worth a second glance — which is exactly why nobody's read it carefully. A separate scrap, found elsewhere on the body, bears only the number 7, underlined twice.",
    solution: "Counting only the letters (ignoring spaces and punctuation) and taking every 7th one spells T-R-A-I-T-O-R: TRAITOR. The 'boring' letter is a coded accusation smuggled past a censor or a suspicious courier service — the merchant was naming someone as a traitor without writing the word outright.",
    note: "DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) to think to count letters at all rather than dismiss the letter as filler — the underlined '7' is the key nudge, so make sure players who search the body find it. A miscount just produces a near-miss word (still recognizably close to TRAITOR) rather than total gibberish, so don't punish an off-by-one too harshly. Reward: the identity of an actual traitor NPC in your current plot, or the seed for one if you don't have one yet."

A dead signal-officer nearby clutches a torn codebook page giving a partial key: crimson bar = R, ivory anchor = U, onyx wave = N, golden sun = A, iron cross = T, silver moon = D, emerald serpent = W.",
    solution: "Reading the banners left to right against the codebook key gives R, U, N, A, T, D, A, W, N — RUN AT DAWN. It's an intercepted signal between the garrison's commanders, coordinating a breakout, an attack, or a relief column's arrival at dawn.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation), or a relevant military/signaling background check, to think to cross-reference the banners against the codebook page rather than dismiss them as decoration. Missing the signal means the garrison's dawn action catches the party by surprise — a real, scaled encounter.

Those who wish to Meet with the assessor may do so At the hall gates. Payment after Dusk will not be accepted, and latecomers will be fined double.' Nothing about it looks unusual at a glance — it's just one more posted rule among several others nearby.",
    solution: "Three words are capitalized mid-sentence where they shouldn't be: Meet, At, Dusk. Read in order, they spell MEET AT DUSK — a covert instruction smuggled past the warden's own censors, almost certainly organizing something among the prisoners themselves.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) to notice the odd capitalization at all amid a wall of similar-looking notices — you can lower this to DC 10 if the party has already been told prisoners here are planning something. Missing it means walking into the meeting unprepared if the party stumbles onto it anyway — a real, scaled encounter with whoever's gathered.

A plaque reads: 'Set true, and the way is shown.' The mechanism only unlocks (revealing a hidden compartment, staircase, or door) when its rings are turned to match the actual night sky as it looked on [the specific night you described earlier — e.g., the night of the eclipse, the night the beacon was lit, or any night you gave vivid sky detail for].",
    solution: "The rings must be turned to reproduce the constellations, moon phase, and any notable celestial event (comet, eclipse, planetary alignment) exactly as you described them on that earlier night. If you haven't yet given the party enough specific sky detail to solve this cold, seed it retroactively: have an NPC astronomer, a diary entry, or a mural nearby describe 'the sky as it was that night' in the same terms you'll need the players to match on the rings.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation, or History if they were present for the original night) as a hint if players are stuck — the mechanism can visibly show 'close but not quite' rather than a flat no. A wrong alignment just resets with a soft click, no trap, letting them try again with a fresh guess. If they missed the original sky description entirely, let a stargazing NPC nearby recall it for them (a fallback hint, not a hard wall).

The party must either wait for that date to roll around in-game, or find another way to convince the lock that the festival is happening (a ritual reenactment, festival garb, a specific offering associated with the holiday, etc.).",
    solution: "If your calendar already has an established festival with a fixed date (or a date tied to a moon phase/solstice you've mentioned), that's the trigger date. If you haven't seeded a festival yet, do it now — have an NPC mention an upcoming holiday in passing, post a festival announcement in the next town, or let the players find a festival calendar in this very location listing the date.",
    note: "DC 13 History or Religion to recall festival dates if a player missed the earlier mention. Rather than force real-time waiting, let a clever workaround (dressing the part, performing the associated ritual, bringing the traditional offering) succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Performance) check as a shortcut — a satisfying alternative to a hard multi-week wait. A failed attempt just fails quietly, no trap. Reward: whatever the festival lock protects, ideally something thematically tied to that holiday's meaning."

A locked mechanism nearby has a dial with notches for a specific number, and a note reads: 'Turn it once for every moon between the oath and the breaking.'",
    solution: "Count the number of full lunar cycles between the two described events using your campaign's calendar (standard fantasy convention: one full moon roughly every 28-30 days, i.e., once per in-game month). If you haven't tracked moon phases explicitly, pick a plausible number of months that fits your timeline and simply declare that count as correct — the puzzle only needs internal consistency, not real astronomical precision.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (History or Investigation) to help a player reconstruct the timeline if they've lost track of session dates — this is a good moment to just tell them the answer via an NPC who kept better records. Turning the dial to the wrong number just doesn't seat correctly and can be freely retried, no trap.

Scattered among the correct stars are decoy clusters that almost, but don't quite, match the description.",
    solution: "The correct answer is whichever star pattern matches the shape and story details you gave when you first named the constellation. If you haven't described it in enough visual detail yet to make this solvable, have the astronomer NPC (or a book found in this very room) describe it now: give it a clear shape (e.g., 'five stars in a rough bow, with one bright star at the string') so players have something concrete to match against the carvings.",
    note: "DC 11 Intelligence (Investigation) or Nature to narrow down the decoys if the party is guessing blind. Pressing a wrong cluster can trigger a minor, non-lethal setback (a puff of stale air, a startling chime, a brief false-light illusion) rather than damage, and doesn't lock them out from trying again.

The party must either wait for that hour or find a way to fake the shadow's position.",
    solution: "The correct hour is whatever time you attached to the earlier event. If you haven't given a specific hour yet, this is a fine moment to add one via an NPC's testimony ('it happened just as the shadow touched the third mark') so the players have a concrete target.",
    note: "DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) to work out that the dial's marks correspond to the hours mentioned elsewhere in the mystery. If waiting for the real hour would stall the session too long, let the party fake it with a torch or magical light held at the correct angle, succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence check to get the geometry right — a nice puzzle-within-a-puzzle rather than a hard multi-hour wait. A wrong attempt just fails to trigger anything. Reward: whatever the mechanism reveals, ideally information or access tied directly to the original event's mystery."

A locked archive or shrine only opens for someone who can state how many years passed between the two sightings.",
    solution: "Subtract the two dates you've established for those events to get the number of years between comet sightings, and that's the number the mechanism wants (spoken aloud, dialed in, or written down, your choice of format). If you haven't pinned down exact years for either event, invent round numbers now (e.g., 'forty years apart') — the puzzle just needs the party to do the subtraction correctly once you give them both dates.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (History) to recall or reconstruct the dates if the party has forgotten details from earlier sessions — an NPC scholar or a dusty chronicle in the same room is a fair fallback source. An incorrect number just fails to open the lock with no trap triggered.

The party must be present during an actual in-game eclipse — either one you've already foreshadowed as upcoming, or one they need to calculate the timing of from [an eclipse you described happening earlier], using a cycle length given on a nearby star-chart (commonly a fixed number of years for a solar eclipse to recur in a given region, e.g., 'every eleven years the shadow returns').",
    solution: "If you've already set a date for an upcoming eclipse in your campaign calendar, that's the trigger. If not, retroactively establish one now: state the cycle length (any consistent number works, 11 years is a reasonable folk-astronomy figure) and count forward from the eclipse you previously described to give the party a concrete future date to aim for.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana or History) to do the cycle-length math correctly, with a fallback where an astronomer NPC simply tells them the date if they're stuck or if waiting for a real future eclipse doesn't fit your session pacing. If you'd rather not stall the plot on a real-time wait, let the party trigger an artificial 'eclipse' with the right combination of shadow magic, an eclipse-relic, or a ritual — treat it as an equivalent solution.

A nearby inscription reads: 'Turn me to the day the bells rang for [the festival or historical date you've established, e.g., the founding of the town, the Sowing Feast].' The wheel only unlocks a mechanism when the correct date is aligned with a fixed pointer.",
    solution: "Align the wheel to whichever date you've previously attached to that festival or event. If you haven't given a specific date yet, this is a good place to have a townsperson mention it in passing ('always around the first frost' or similar), giving the players something concrete to match to the wheel's carved months.",
    note: "DC 10 History or Religion to recall the date if a player forgot it. Misaligning the wheel just doesn't seat the mechanism and can be freely retried — no trap, no penalty beyond a little wasted time.

A weathered sign reads: 'As the moon stood on [the night you described the tide or moon in an earlier coastal scene], so must it stand again.' The party must set the dial to match that remembered phase to trigger the gate.",
    solution: "Set the dial to whichever moon phase you described during that earlier coastal scene (new, full, or a specific crescent/gibbous stage). If you never specified one, decide now and let an old fisherman or the shrine's own carvings supply it as a fresh clue rather than making the players guess blind.",
    note: "DC 11 Intelligence (Investigation) or a sailor's background check to recall or reconstruct the correct phase. Setting the dial wrong just means the gate stays shut and the tide doesn't cooperate — no danger, just a delay until the next correct attempt.

A verse on the wall hints at each idol's associated season through imagery (harvest sheaves, bare branches, new blossoms, high sun) without naming the season outright.",
    solution: "Match each idol's imagery to a season and place them in your calendar's established order, starting from the anchor season you've previously set (or simply spring-summer-autumn-winter if you haven't established anything more specific). If your world's calendar hasn't come up yet, this is a low-stakes place to establish it on the fly.",
    note: "DC 10 Nature or Religion to correctly match imagery to season if a player is unsure. Placing an idol wrong just fails to seat it properly in the rack — freely correctable, no trap. Reward: whatever the completed ritual triggers, from a blessing effect to a hidden compartment in the rack's base."

A buried marker or hidden door is only found by standing where both bearings would have crossed.",
    solution: "Plot roughly where the two described bearings intersect on your local map — this doesn't need real trigonometry, just a sensible in-fiction location that makes sense given both descriptions (e.g., 'a hilltop equidistant from both landmarks the stars were sighted over'). Decide this ahead of time and place the actual objective there.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) or Nature (Survival) to work out roughly where the two bearings cross without exact math — treat this as a reasoning puzzle, not a geometry test.

    prompt: "Your world's calendar cycles through a repeating sequence of year-beasts (adapt freely — a Wolf Year, a Serpent Year, a Stag Year, and so on), and a stone wheel or tapestry depicts the full cycle. A locked shrine only responds to whichever beast matches the current in-game year, which the party should be able to work out from [omens, festivals, or NPC comments you've dropped earlier tying certain events to certain year-beasts].",
    solution: "Identify the current year-beast from whatever clues you've planted (an NPC saying 'it's a bad year to be born under the Wolf' or a festival banner depicting the correct beast). If you haven't established this yet, an elder or scholar nearby can simply state which year it is, giving the party the answer they need on the spot rather than forcing them to have tracked it from session one.",
    note: "DC 10 History or Religion to recall the current year-beast if it's been mentioned before. Choosing the wrong beast on the wheel just doesn't trigger the mechanism and can be retried. Reward: whatever the shrine protects, plus a nice worldbuilding touch if you want this beast-cycle to recur later in the campaign."

A combination lock or ritual timing depends on knowing the coming eclipse's exact year.",
    solution: "Add the cycle length to the year of the earlier eclipse to get the target date. If you haven't previously set an exact year for that first eclipse, assign one now and let the chart itself state the cycle length plainly, so the arithmetic is straightforward once the party has both numbers.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or History) to do the calculation cleanly, with an NPC astronomer as a fallback who can simply confirm the answer if the party is stuck or if the resulting date doesn't comfortably fit your session's pacing. A wrong guess at the lock just doesn't open it, no trap. Reward: whatever the timed mechanism protects, ideally something that pays off the eclipse as a recurring piece of your world's astronomy."

The party must either be present at that hour or manufacture the correct shadow angle artificially.",
    solution: "The correct hour is whatever time you attached to that earlier festival or ritual. If you haven't specified one, have a townsperson or ritual attendant recall it now ('always at the ninth bell, just as the light touches the altar') to give the players a concrete target.",
    note: "DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or Religion to recall the correct hour.

    solution: "Arrange the panels in the same order the astronomer originally described the constellations appearing overhead. If that order hasn't been established yet, have the astronomer (or a book/scroll in this very room) lay it out now in clear, memorable terms — first the Hunter, then the Serpent, and so on — so the party has something to work from.",
    note: "DC 11 Intelligence (Investigation) or History to recall the order if the party heard it described earlier but forgot the sequence. Placing a panel out of order just fails to trigger the mechanism and is freely correctable.

A mechanism, timeline mural, or NPC riddle requires the party to correctly order these events by season, not by the order they learned about them.",
    solution: "Match each event's described weather or festival detail to a season in your calendar, then sequence them accordingly. If any event's seasonal detail hasn't actually been given yet, this is a good moment to supply it via a witness's recollection, giving the players a fair basis for the ordering rather than asking them to guess.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) to piece together the seasonal clues if the party hasn't been tracking them closely. Getting the order wrong just produces an incorrect (but harmless) timeline that a sharp-eyed NPC or a re-examination of clues can correct.

    solution: "Find the next date both cycles coincide (the lowest common multiple of the two cycle lengths, counted forward from your last confirmed sighting date). If you haven't given exact cycle lengths yet, assign simple round numbers now so the math stays clean and satisfying rather than obscure.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) for the calculation, with an astrologer NPC available as a fallback to simply state the date if the party is stuck or the math would stall the session too long.

Pressing the correct panel triggers a hidden mechanism.",
    solution: "The correct panel is whichever one matches the sky details from that earlier scene. If you didn't describe it in enough visual detail at the time to make this solvable now, have a caretaker, tour-guide NPC, or accompanying plaque describe 'the night the stars aligned so' in matching terms, effectively re-supplying the clue in the room itself.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) to narrow down the correct panel among several similar decoys. Pressing a wrong panel can trigger a small, harmless effect (a chime, a puff of illusory stardust, a brief flicker of light) rather than a trap, and doesn't prevent further attempts. Reward: whatever the mechanism reveals, and a nice touch if the correct panel's night ties thematically to the room's purpose."

    prompt: "A collapsed structure has a series of small notches or star-symbols carved into a support pillar, clearly meant as a tally of some kind. A surviving inscription nearby says the ruin was sealed 'the year the sky wept fire' — referring to [a comet, meteor shower, or celestial omen you described happening earlier in the campaign, at a known point in your timeline]. The party must count the notches and match them against known events to work out how long ago the ruin was actually sealed.",
    solution: "Each notch represents one year (or one full star-cycle, your choice), counted backward from the present. Cross-reference the total against the date of the celestial omen you described earlier to confirm the ruin was sealed at that same time — the notch count and the referenced omen should agree once you've settled on both figures.",
    note: "DC 12 Intelligence (History or Investigation) to count the notches accurately and connect them to the referenced omen. A miscount just gives a slightly wrong age estimate, which a second, more careful count can correct — no trap tied to the counting itself. Reward: understanding the ruin's true age often unlocks a bigger revelation (who sealed it, why, and whether that reason still matters today) rather than physical loot."

A verse reads: 'When [the first moon] stood as it did the night of [an event you described], and [the second moon] as it did that same night, the door remembers and opens.' The party must set both dials to match the remembered phases of that single, specific night.",
    solution: "Set each dial to the phase you described for its respective moon during that earlier scene. If you haven't given both moons' phases for that night, decide them now and have a nearby astronomer's notes or shrine carving state them clearly, so the party has concrete targets for both dials rather than one.",
    note: "DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) to recall or reconstruct both phases, especially if only one was clearly described before — allow a generous fallback where an NPC or written record supplies whichever phase is missing. Misaligning either dial just fails to open the door, freely retriable.

Three bronze mirrors on swiveling arms line the walls, each dented from age, along with a faded mural showing a beam of light bouncing off a mountain, a wave, and a flame before striking a jewel.",
    solution: "The mural shows the beam's path in order: mountain (topmost mirror, angled steeply down), wave (the mirror nearest the floor, angled up), then flame (the last mirror, aimed level at the gem). Setting the three mirrors to steep-down, floor-up, level-straight in that order channels the window's sunbeam into the gem, which flares and unlocks the cradle, swinging open a hidden floor hatch beneath it.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to notice the mural sequence at all; DC 16 to read it correctly without a hint. A wrongly angled mirror just scatters the light harmlessly, so players can adjust freely with no penalty until the beam lands true.

Four wheel-valves sit on pedestals around the room, each stamped with a different fish, and a drowned mosaic on the ceiling shows the four fish swimming in a specific order toward a carved sun.",
    solution: "The mosaic shows the swim order: catfish, eel, pike, then salmon, chasing the sun (which represents the exit). Turning the valves shut in that exact order — catfish first, salmon last — reverses the spouts into drains, lowering the water fast enough to clear the door before it fully submerges.",
    note: "Perception DC 14 to spot the ceiling mosaic before the water gets high enough to obscure it. Turning valves in the wrong order does nothing bad by itself, but wastes precious rounds — track 6 rounds until the door is fully sealed, creating real time pressure without being an instant kill (the room has an air pocket near the ceiling as a backstop). Reward: a waterproof strongbox that floats free once the tide recedes, containing a minor potion cache."

High on the wall, a faded tide-chart fresco shows a fisherman's footprints crossing from a boat symbol to a lighthouse symbol, stepping only on blue tiles.",
    solution: "The fresco's footprints trace a path exclusively across the blue-glazed tiles, from the boat-shaped starting tile to the lighthouse-shaped exit tile. All non-blue tiles are pressure plates that trigger a dart trap or alarm. As the water drains, the party can watch which tiles the fresco's painted footprints pass over and match the real floor to it.",
    note: "A character can use an action to study the fresco and floor together for an automatic match, or roll Investigation DC 15 to shortcut it. Stepping on a wrong tile triggers a loud alarm bell (alerting nearby guards/monsters) rather than direct damage, letting players recover and reroute. Reward: a sealed urn of preserved incense worth 75 gp, found once the room fully drains."

A half-finished tapestry on the loom depicts the four seasons in a spiral pattern, but the spiral has been deliberately woven starting from winter rather than spring.",
    solution: "The tapestry's spiral, read starting from the bare-tree (winter) panel and moving inward, gives the true order: winter, spring, summer, autumn. Pulling the levers in that sequence — bare tree, budding branch, sun, falling leaf — releases the loom's tension bar and slides the wall panel behind it open.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to notice the spiral starts at winter instead of spring, which is the trick. Pulling levers out of order simply resets the loom's tension with a loud clack and no harm, so players can brute-force all 24 orders if patient, though a nearby wandering monster check every few failed attempts adds pressure. Reward: a set of weaver's tools that grant advantage on checks to identify magic textiles."

A tarnished mirror hangs on a pivot near the altar, and the submerged floor below is checkered with stone tiles, some of which release a jolt of numbing cold when stepped on. Faded gold lettering along the domed ceiling reads: 'Where the light falls true, the faithful may walk.'",
    solution: "The mirror must be angled so the shaft of light reflects down onto the floor tiles, tracing a lit path from the entrance to the altar. That lit path is also the only safe path across the pressure-plate floor — every tile the reflected beam touches is safe, and every tile in shadow triggers the cold jolt.",
    note: "Once the mirror is angled correctly (Investigation or a simple trial-and-error swivel, no roll needed to attempt), the safe path is visually obvious and needs no further roll. A wrong tile deals 1d6 cold damage and knocks the target prone in the water rather than anything lethal. Reward: a silver choir bell that calms hostile beasts within 30 feet once per day when rung."

A brass astrolabe bolted to the wall shows the sky as it appeared 'on the night the tower was raised,' according to an engraved plaque, with three specific glyphs aligned along its central spine.",
    solution: "The astrolabe fixes three glyphs — the Serpent, the Anvil, and the Lantern — in a straight line down its spine. Rotating the three floor rings so those same three glyphs line up beneath the skylight causes the rings to lock and a section of the domed ceiling to slide open, dropping a rope ladder to the tower's hidden archive above.",
    note: "Arcana or Investigation DC 14 to read the astrolabe's alignment correctly. Rotating the rings to a wrong alignment does nothing except require re-rotating, though the rings are stiff and each rotation costs an action, adding time pressure if something is chasing the party.

The room holds five identical-looking iron ingots stacked nearby, along with a small brass plaque reading: 'Truth is never the heaviest, nor the lightest, but the middle path.'",
    solution: "The five ingots are subtly different weights (a Perception check or simply hefting each one reveals it). The plaque means the party must place the third-heaviest ingot — the exact median weight — on the empty side of the scale to balance it against a fixed counterweight sealed into the plinth, which unlocks the vault door.",
    note: "Perception DC 15 to notice the ingots' weight differs at all; otherwise a character can spend a turn manually comparing them by hand instead. Placing the wrong ingot just fails to balance the scale — nothing triggers, it simply doesn't unlock, so players can swap ingots freely. Reward: 200 gp in worked silver ingots, plus the vault's contents (DM's choice of treasure)."

Three unlit braziers stand nearby, and a frozen hunter's corpse still clutches a scrap of hide bearing a crude drawing — wolf tracks leading to raven feathers, raven feathers leading to bear claw marks.",
    solution: "The hide drawing indicates the melt order: wolf door first, then raven door, then bear door. Lighting the matching brazier beside each door (using any fire source) melts that door's ice after one full round if done in the correct sequence; lighting them out of order causes the ice to simply refreeze thicker on doors lit prematurely.",
    note: "Survival or Investigation DC 13 to interpret the tracking drawing. Lighting braziers out of order costs time (the wrongly-melted door refreezes over the next minute, requiring a re-light) but never harms the party — good for slow, careful experimentation. Reward: a frost-touched hand axe (treat as a +1 weapon that deals an extra 1d4 cold damage) frozen into the wall beyond the bear door."

A rusted weathervane spins wildly atop a central pole, and a carving beside it shows an arrow pointing due east, with the words 'Still the breath, save one, and the tower will point true.'",
    solution: "The party must close every damper except the one whose flue faces east (identifiable by sunlight/wind direction, or by matching flue positions to a compass rose etched faintly on the floor). With every other flue sealed, the remaining eastern draft spins the weathervane until it locks pointing east, which releases the floor grate beneath it.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to spot the faint compass rose on the floor that identifies true east. Closing the wrong damper does nothing harmful — it just fails to produce the correct draft, and dampers can be reopened freely to try again.

A single beam of magical violet light pulses from a crystal orb at one end of the hall, and a sealed prism sits in a socket at the far end, clearly meant to catch it.",
    solution: "There are five mirrors, and only a specific three need to be slid into position and angled to bounce the beam in a zigzag down the hall to the prism; the other two are decoys that, if used, simply refract the light off into the walls. Careful trial and error (or Arcana DC 15 to trace the beam's likely path visually) reveals which three mirrors sit on the true line.",
    note: "Wrong mirror placement just scatters the beam with no effect — completely safe to experiment with, though each adjustment takes an action, so a ticking clock (patrol, encroaching effect) helps create urgency without punishing failure directly. Reward: when the prism catches the beam, it discharges into a wand of the DM's choice appearing in the now-unsealed socket."

A brass plaque nearby reads 'Three turns closes what the sea has opened,' and a domed alcove overhead holds a visible pocket of trapped air.",
    solution: "The sluice wheel must be turned exactly three full rotations in the reverse direction (opposite to how it is currently spinning) to seal the crack it is slowly widening. Turning it the wrong way accelerates the flooding instead. The air pocket in the domed alcove buys the party a safety margin if they misjudge the timing.",
    note: "No roll needed to identify the correct direction if a player thinks to reverse the wheel's current spin; award a hint at Investigation DC 12 otherwise. Turning it the wrong way for too long floods the room over 3 rounds, forcing a swim to the air pocket rather than causing direct harm.

A weathered statue of a gardener stands at the entrance, one stone foot frozen mid-step on a specific paving stone, its other foot raised toward the next.",
    solution: "The statue's stance shows the exact stride pattern needed: left-right-right-left across the terraces, matching the safe stones. Any character who mimics the statue's foot spacing while crossing (or who maps the safe stones by comparing them to the statue's pose) crosses without triggering the bells.",
    note: "Investigation DC 14 to notice the statue's foot pose is a literal map of the safe path rather than decoration. A wrong step doesn't harm the party, it just rings the bells loudly, drawing 1 random wandering monster check rather than dealing damage. Reward: a pouch of moonpetal seeds worth 40 gp to an herbalist, growing wild in the terraces."

    solution: "The hymn describes the fire's life cycle in order: breath (the cold brazier, representing unlit air) must be lit first, then the smoking one (spark), then the banked coals (blaze), and finally the roaring brazier is allowed to burn down to embers (ash) last by smothering it. Performing all four actions in that order — light, light, feed, smother — causes the central floor medallion to sink and open a passage below.",
    note: "Religion or Investigation DC 14 to parse the hymn as literal instructions rather than poetry. Performing a step out of order simply produces no effect on the medallion (braziers can be relit or resmothered freely), keeping this a low-stakes puzzle for methodical players. Reward: a flask of everburning oil (never runs out, but only fuels non-magical flame)."

Four empty pedestals are bolted at the corners of the room, and four matching statues (a knight, a monk, a merchant, a child) lie where they slid, each of noticeably different weight.",
    solution: "The room is a giant balance built into the hull; placing all four statues onto their pedestals in a specific corner arrangement — heaviest (the knight) opposite lightest (the child), and the monk opposite the merchant — levels the floor evenly. Once level, the sealed hatch in the ceiling releases and drops a ladder.",
    note: "Athletics checks are needed just to drag the heavier statues (DC 12–15 depending on which one). Placing statues in a poor arrangement just leaves the floor tilted and nothing more happens — no damage, just continued sliding hazard (difficult terrain) until corrected.

A hooded window above lets in a single beam of daylight, currently striking a blank patch of wall. A star-chart on the desk notes: 'When the red wanderer stands beside the hearth-star, the door remembers its name.'",
    solution: "The party must turn the orrery's hand-crank to advance the mechanism until the red-painted planet aligns directly beside the crystal sun (the 'hearth-star'), which rotates the tower's outer shutters just enough to redirect the daylight beam onto a hidden rune on the wall, which glows and unlocks the study's inner door.",
    note: "Arcana DC 13 to correctly identify which painted sphere is the 'red wanderer' from the star-chart's description. Cranking to the wrong position does nothing but require more cranking — the mechanism is slow (1 minute per attempt) but entirely safe.

The hermit's ghost, if the party speaks with it (or a journal found nearby), mutters that he 'always locked it the same way his grandfather taught him: the quiet hunter, the night watcher, the slow guardian.'",
    solution: "The three phrases map to totems: 'the quiet hunter' is the fox, 'the night watcher' is the owl, 'the slow guardian' is the bear. Rotating the three discs to show fox, owl, bear in that left-to-right order releases the door's bolt.",
    note: "This is pure roleplay/lore extraction — no roll needed if the party actually talks to the ghost or reads the journal; otherwise Investigation DC 15 to find the journal passage.

A carved eel motif circles the basin's rim with an arrow showing which channel should run strongest.",
    solution: "Closing two of the three sluice gates so that only the channel marked by the eel's arrow flows at full strength calms that portion of the basin, letting the water settle glass-still over the mirrored floor. Once still, the mirrored floor reflects a hidden glyph painted on the ceiling, which is the actual answer needed for the shrine's altar (a simple word or symbol prompt the DM can tie to the dungeon's larger theme).",
    note: "Investigation DC 12 to identify the correct channel from the eel carving. Leaving the wrong gates open just keeps the water choppy and the reflection unreadable, an easily reversible state. Reward: a vial of shrine water that functions as a potion of water breathing when consumed."

Four hand-cranked bellows stand around the shaft's rim, each connected to a different vent, and a faded diagram on the wall shows the platform rising only when vents are filled in a staggered pattern rather than all at once.",
    solution: "The diagram shows the vents must be pumped in a rotating pattern — vent one, then vent three, then vent two, then vent four, repeating — rather than all four at once, which would overpressure and stall the mechanism. Two party members working two bellows each in that rotation raises the platform smoothly to the bottom of the shaft.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to correctly read the diagram's staggered pattern; without it, players can experiment freely. Pumping incorrectly just stalls the platform a few feet up with a hiss of escaping air rather than dropping it, so failure only costs time. Reward: nothing tangible here, but the platform ride skips what would otherwise be a lengthy, resource-draining climb down."

The domed ceiling above is punched through with small holes that, at midday, cast a scatter of light dots onto the floor matching a constellation.",
    solution: "The pattern of light dots cast through the ceiling's holes lands exactly on the safe (non-vent) sections of floor at midday. Following the dots of light across the flat, rather than walking any other path, crosses safely; the puzzle is time-sensitive only in the sense that the dots shift slowly as the sun moves, so a fast crossing is easiest.",
    note: "Perception DC 14 to notice the correlation between the ceiling holes and the light dots on the floor. Triggering a vent sprays a target with stinging salt crystal (1d4 damage, and disadvantage on Perception until it's washed off) rather than anything worse.

An engraved plate reads: 'Match the forge-song, walk between the coals, and the gate remembers the smith who built it.' A faint humming can be heard from the furnaces at different pitches.",
    solution: "The two furnaces must be adjusted (via their damper wheels) until their humming pitches match one another exactly — this is the 'forge-song.' Once matched, the previously warm floor plates cool to safe temperature (they were rigged to scald anyone crossing while the furnaces were mismatched, as a kind of tuning-based trap), letting the party walk the plates safely to the gate, which then swings open.",
    note: "Perception DC 13 to notice the differing pitches; a character proficient with smith's tools or an instrument gets advantage on adjusting the dampers to match them. Crossing the plates before matching the pitches deals 1d6 fire damage per plate crossed, a real but non-lethal cost that rewards patience.

    solution: "The statue plays a randomized sequence (DM picks 4–6 bell rings from the four bells, e.g., small-large-medium-small). Players must ring the same bells in the same order using ropes at the base of each bell. Getting it right causes the statue to bow and the belfry trapdoor to unlock.",
    note: "No roll needed, this is pure listen-and-repeat; a character can ask the statue to repeat the pattern once per short rest if they're unsure. A wrong sequence just resets the statue to try again with no penalty, ideal for a tension-free warm-up puzzle.

    note: "No roll, purely a memory challenge for the table — consider writing the sequence down after showing it once, out of character, since remembering long sequences from a verbal description is harder than seeing lit tiles. A wrong step causes a harmless flash and buzz and restarts that round's sequence only (not the whole thing).

The 'shrine forgets you tried' line is flavor only: mismatches simply flip back with no other cost.

    prompt: "A ghostly watchman paces a looping route through a ruined guardhouse each night, always pausing at the same four spots in the same order — a window, a weapon rack, a hearth, and a locked chest — before fading and starting over. He does not react to the party unless they interfere with his route.",
    solution: "The four spots the ghost pauses at, in order, are the actual sequence needed to unlock the chest: examining the window, touching the weapon rack, warming hands at the hearth, then approaching the chest triggers its lock to click open, mimicking the ritual the watchman performed every night in life to secure it.",
    note: "Perception DC 13 to notice the ghost's route is consistent and identical each loop (roughly 2 minutes per loop) rather than random wandering. Performing the actions out of order does nothing, and the ghost is passive, so there's no risk in observing multiple loops to confirm the pattern. Reward: the chest holds the watchman's old badge, a keepsake that grants advantage on Persuasion checks with any town guard once the party proves they returned it to his descendants (a roleplay hook, not a mechanical trinket)."

  {
    title: "The Dynastic Gallery",
    prompt: "Six portraits line a gallery hall, each depicting a different ruler, but a plaque beneath each one has been swapped and mislabeled by vandals, giving the wrong ruler's name and reign dates under each face. A locked case at the hall's end can only be opened by pressing the portraits in true chronological order of their reigns.",
    solution: "The party must use context clues scattered elsewhere in the gallery (subtle details in the paintings' backgrounds, style of dress, weapons, or a nearby history book) to determine the true chronological order, ignoring the deliberately swapped plaques. Pressing the six portraits frame-edges in the correct true order unlocks the case.",
    note: "History DC 15 (or Investigation DC 13 if a history book is found and read first) to reconstruct the true order from visual clues alone. Pressing portraits in the wrong order simply doesn't unlock anything and can be retried freely. Reward: the case holds a ceremonial crown replica worth 100 gp and a strong hook for a noble-house subplot."

    title: "The Shepherd's Tune",
    prompt: "A set of wooden pipes lies beside a carved shepherd statue in a highland shrine, and a few notes of a simple folk tune are etched into the wall as musical notation, cut off mid-phrase. A shepherd's crook rests against the statue, inscribed 'finish what the flock forgot.'",
    solution: "The etched notation shows the first half of a simple, repeating four-note folk melody; a character with any musical training (or a successful Performance check) can recognize the melodic pattern and complete the final phrase by continuing the same interval pattern on the pipes. Playing the completed tune causes the statue's crook to swing aside, revealing a niche.",
    note: "Performance DC 13 to correctly intuit and play the missing notes (advantage if the character has proficiency with any instrument or the Music package background). A wrong note just produces a sour honk with no other consequence, and can be attempted as many times as needed. Reward: a small clay ocarina that, once per day, can calm one beast or animal automatically (DM's discretion on exact mechanics, similar to a limited-use calm emotions on animals only)."

    title: "The Rememberer's Cards",
    prompt: "A dusty table holds sixteen carved wooden tiles laid face down in a 4x4 grid inside an old sage's study, each stamped with a rune. A tin sign propped nearby reads: 'Eight pairs, eight truths. Fail twice more than you succeed, and the study's wards will notice.'",
    solution: "Another matching-pairs memory puzzle, larger than most (eight pairs among sixteen tiles). Unlike the smaller Reliquary of Pairs, this one has a real cost for excessive failure: the sign's warning is literal.",
    note: "No roll needed to attempt (or Intelligence DC 12 per flip if the DM wants to abstract memory), but track mismatches: after the number of failed flips exceeds successful matches by more than 2, the study's wards trigger a minor shock (1d4 force damage to whoever is flipping tiles) and the grid reshuffles itself, forcing the party to restart their mental map. This creates real risk for careless guessing rather than being purely tension-free. Reward: completing all eight pairs opens a drawer with a scroll of a 2nd-level spell of the DM's choice."

    title: "The Drummer's Count",
    prompt: "In a ceremonial war-room, a cracked drum sits before a mural of tribal warriors dancing in a ring, and a faded caption beneath reads: 'Three for the chief, five for the hunt, two for the harvest, and the circle is closed.' A locked weapon case sits against the far wall.",
    solution: "The caption gives a rhythmic beat-count sequence: strike the drum 3 times, then 5 times, then 2 times, in that order without extra beats in between, mimicking a ceremonial drumroll. Performing the beat pattern correctly causes the weapon case to unlatch.",
    note: "No roll needed if a player just literally counts out the beats as instructed; Investigation DC 10 if they need help realizing the caption is instructional rather than decorative. Miscounting the beats does nothing but require starting the pattern over from the first count of three, fully safe. Reward: the case holds a well-preserved ceremonial spear (treat as a masterwork spear, or a +1 weapon at the DM's discretion for higher-power games)."

  {
    title: "The Sunlit Window",
    prompt: "A stained-glass window in a ruined chapel is missing several of its colored panes, replaced with plain glass, while a row of colored gems sits in a box below, unset. A verse etched into the sill reads: 'Red for the dawn, gold for the noon, blue for the dusk, and violet alone for the moon, in the order the sky wears them.'",
    solution: "The verse gives the color order directly: red, gold, blue, violet, matching dawn to moon. Setting the loose gems into the empty panes in that left-to-right (or bottom-to-top, matching the window's layout) order causes the window to blaze with colored light and open a wall panel beneath it when the sun (or a torch held behind it) shines through.",
    note: "No roll needed if the party reads the verse; Investigation DC 10 otherwise to notice the verse is meant to be read as instructions. Setting a gem into the wrong pane does nothing but require moving it to the correct one, entirely reversible. Reward: one of the gems turns out to be a genuine violet garnet worth 50 gp in addition to completing the puzzle."

    title: "The Dancer's Diagram",
    prompt: "A ballroom floor in a haunted manor is inlaid with a spiral of numbered tiles, and a faded dance instruction card framed on the wall shows a diagram of footprint pairs numbered 1 through 8, mapping out a formal dance's steps across the spiral.",
    solution: "The party must walk the numbered tiles in the exact order shown on the framed diagram (1 through 8), effectively performing the dance's footwork across the floor. Completing the full sequence in order causes the chandelier overhead to lower on its chain, revealing a hidden compartment in its base.",
    note: "No roll needed for a careful, deliberate walk matching the diagram; Investigation DC 10 if the party is rushing and needs a nudge to notice the numbers correspond to floor tiles. Stepping out of sequence causes the tile to sink an inch with a groan and reset the whole spiral, requiring the party to start the sequence over, but with no damage or trap. Reward: the compartment holds a pair of dancing slippers that grant advantage on Acrobatics checks to avoid falling prone."

    title: "The Candlelit Zodiac",
    prompt: "Twelve unlit candles ring a circular table in an astrologer's tower, each set beside a different zodiac-like symbol carved into the wood. A star chart pinned to the wall highlights four of the twelve symbols in a faint constellation shape, connected by drawn lines in a specific order the chart labels with small numbers.",
    solution: "The chart's numbered lines indicate the order to light exactly those four highlighted candles: for example, the Ram, then the Scales, then the Serpent, then the Lantern (DM can substitute specific symbols to match the dungeon's theme). Lighting only those four, in that order, and leaving the other eight dark, causes the table's center to rise into a small crystal orb display.",
    note: "Arcana or Investigation DC 14 to correctly trace the numbered constellation lines on the chart. Lighting an extra or wrong candle causes all lit candles to snuff out at once, resetting the attempt with no other consequence — a clean, repeatable puzzle. Reward: the orb display contains a shard of petrified starlight (usable as a spell component for any divination spell, or worth 40 gp to a collector)."

  {
    title: "The Bell Tower Rhyme",
    prompt: "A child's rhyme is carved crudely into the wall of a bell tower, clearly added long after the tower's construction: 'Pull the fat one, then the thin, then the cracked one joins right in, pull them wrong and you'll begin again, but pull the boomer last, my friend.' Four bell-ropes of different thickness hang from the ceiling, one visibly cracked near the top.",
    solution: "The rhyme gives the pull order directly: the fat rope, then the thin rope, then the cracked rope, and finally the largest/loudest rope (the 'boomer') last. Pulling them in that order rings the bells in a specific chime that causes the tower's floor grate to release.",
    note: "No roll needed to follow the rhyme literally; Investigation DC 10 if the party dismisses it as mere decoration and needs a nudge that it's a real clue. Pulling ropes out of order causes the bells to clang discordantly and the rhyme's carving to glow faintly red, resetting the sequence, no harm done. Reward: a small bag of 25 gp in old offering coins found in the grate below."
  },
  {
    title: "The Incense Procession",
    prompt: "Six small censers sit unlit around a meditation chamber, each carved with a different flower. A wall fresco, badly faded but still legible in patches, shows robed figures carrying censers in a procession, walking past the flowers of a garden in a particular blooming order across the seasons.",
    solution: "The fresco shows the procession passing flowers in their natural spring-to-winter blooming order: crocus, tulip, rose, sunflower, chrysanthemum, and finally a winter-blooming flower like hellebore. Lighting the six censers in that seasonal order fills the room with layered incense smoke that coalesces into a glowing doorway.",
    note: "Nature or Investigation DC 13 to correctly reconstruct the blooming order, especially useful if a player has any gardening or herbalism background for advantage. Lighting censers out of order just produces mismatched, faintly unpleasant smoke with no other effect, freely correctable by snuffing and relighting. Reward: a sprig of preserved hellebore usable as a rare spell component, or worth 25 gp to an alchemist."
  },
  {
    title: "The Crest of Generations",
    prompt: "A family crest is carved into a puzzle box lid, showing four generations of a noble house arranged not by birth order but seemingly at random. A genealogy scroll found elsewhere in the room lists the family's actual birth order, along with a note that 'the box remembers only the true order of blood.'",
    solution: "The party must cross-reference the genealogy scroll against the crest's carved portraits (which are visually similar but subtly different per generation) to determine the true birth order, then press the four portraits on the box in that order to unlock it.",
    note: "Investigation DC 14 to match scroll names to carved portraits accurately (harder than most because the portraits look similar at a glance). Pressing portraits in the wrong order causes the box to click shut tighter and requires a DC 10 Strength check to pry back open for another attempt, a mild but real cost for careless guessing. Reward: the box contains a set of matched signet rings worth 80 gp total, and a strong roleplay hook tying to the family's current descendants."

    title: "The Mirror Chant",
    prompt: "A spectral choirmaster in a ruined amphitheater sings a short four-note phrase, then gestures for the party to answer. When they attempt a response, he seems to want it echoed back not forward, but in reverse, cocking his head expectantly at their first attempt.",
    solution: "The choirmaster is teaching a call-and-response where the correct answer is his phrase played in reverse order (e.g., if he sings low-high-low-mid, the party must respond mid-low-high-low). Any means of producing the notes works — humming, a found instrument, or even ordered bell-pulls elsewhere in the amphitheater. Getting the reversed phrase right causes him to nod and fade, leaving behind a glowing sigil on the stage floor.",
    note: "Performance DC 13 to correctly reverse and reproduce the phrase (advantage for a bard or anyone with a good ear cued by roleplay). A wrong response just makes him tilt his head sadly and repeat the original phrase patiently, no penalty for retries. Reward: the sigil, once touched, grants one character advantage on their next Performance or Persuasion check."

    title: "The Pipe Organ's Breath",
    prompt: "A massive pipe organ dominates a cathedral's ruined nave, several of its pipes visibly broken or missing. A hymnal open on the bench shows a simple rising-then-falling melody, and a note in the margin, in a different hand, warns: 'Play it wrong twice more than right, and the bellows will burst.'",
    solution: "The hymnal shows a melody that rises in pitch across the first half then falls back down in the second half (e.g., low, mid, high, high, mid, low). Playing the working pipes in that rising-falling pattern (skipping the broken pipes automatically, since they don't sound) completes the hymn and opens the choir loft's hidden stair.",
    note: "Performance DC 13 to play the correct pattern on an unfamiliar organ; DC lowered to 10 with proficiency in keyboard instruments if the DM allows it. Unlike most sequence puzzles here, wrong attempts genuinely accumulate: after the second wrong attempt beyond correct ones, the old bellows rupture, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning/thunder damage to whoever is at the keys and disabling the organ until repaired (DC 15 Tinker's Tools or smith's tools check, or simply finding another way through). Reward: completing it correctly reveals a hidden reliquary with a scroll of a 3rd-level spell."

  {
    title: "The Phases of the Vault",
    prompt: "A domed ceiling above a circular vault is carved with eight moon phases in a ring, and eight small levers are set into the floor beneath, each aligned under one carved phase. A worn brass plate at the room's edge simply reads: 'Waxing opens what waning conceals.'",
    solution: "The plate hints that only the four waxing phases (new moon toward full moon) need to be pulled, in the order they appear around the ring moving toward fullness, while the four waning phase levers should be left untouched. Pulling the four correct levers in ascending order of moon fullness unseals the vault door.",
    note: "Astronomy is not a standard skill, so allow Nature or Investigation DC 13 to correctly identify which four carved phases represent 'waxing' and their correct order. Pulling a waning-phase lever by mistake causes a soft chime and that lever alone resets, no broader penalty, letting players correct course easily. Reward: the vault holds a small telescope of the far seer (functions as a spyglass with an added benefit of once/day advantage on a Perception check made at long range, DM's discretion on exact wording)."

  {
    title: "The Growing Chorus",
    prompt: "Five glass orbs are set into an arch above a locked archive door, each one dark. As the party approaches, the leftmost orb flickers once and dims. The archivist ghost drifting nearby murmurs, 'Answer the chorus, and let it grow, or start again from long ago.'",
    solution: "This is a growing Simon-Says: the orbs flash a sequence that starts at length 1 and adds one more flash each time the party successfully repeats it back (by touching the orbs in order), building up to a final sequence of all five in a specific order. Successfully repeating the full five-orb sequence unlocks the archive door.",
    note: "No roll, purely a memory challenge (consider letting a player write down the sequence out of character as it grows, since tracking an audibly-described growing sequence is harder at the table than seeing it). The ghost's warning is literal: any wrong touch resets the sequence all the way back to a single flash, a real but non-damaging cost that punishes carelessness on longer chains. Reward: the archive holds a stack of preserved maps and a scroll of the DM's choice, appropriate to the campaign's next destination."

You may ask exactly two questions total, to either or both of us, before the arch judges your worthiness.' The golems will answer any question, not just yes/no ones.",
    solution: "There's no single required phrasing. The 'textbook' solve is asking one golem what the other would say and inverting it, but reward ANY approach that demonstrates the players understood the logic trap — asking each golem to describe the other, asking a golem to point at the correct door, asking a question whose answer is the same regardless of who's lying ('Is stone heavier than water?' as a calibration question first), or even just picking a golem and building a case with the DM for why their reasoning was sound even if imperfect. The arch should open for good-faith logical effort, not just the 'optimal' formula.",
    note: "No roll required — this is a logic/roleplay puzzle. If the party is stuck after real effort, allow an Insight check (DC 13) on a re-ask to notice a golem's mouth doesn't move in sync with 'lying' answers, giving a hint. Failure to solve doesn't need to be fatal — have the arch simply stay shut and reset the golems' patience, costing a short rest's worth of time."

    solution: "There is no 'trick' item — the puzzle is meant to make the players genuinely debate what they're willing to lose. Valid sacrifices include a sentimental keepsake, a magic item's charge, a spell slot burned permanently for the session, a point of a stat drained temporarily, or even a vow/promise the character must now honor (DM tracks it as a roleplay hook). The basin should reject anything offered cynically (a coin, a torch) with a ripple of refusal, but accept the first thing offered with real reluctance.",
    note: "No check needed to know the basin is testing sincerity — that's given in the prompt. If the party tries to trick it (offering something fake or valueless while claiming otherwise), call for a Deception check opposed by a flat DC 16 'insight' from the shrine; failure causes the basin to flood the room ankle-deep and lock the door for 1 hour. Reward: whatever lies beyond should feel worth the loss — a permanent magic item is fitting."

A traveling farmer nearby claims the dryad's trees were planted on his family's deeded land three generations ago and he has starving tenants to feed this winter. The dryad says the grove existed a thousand years before any deed and that cutting even one branch kills part of her. Both want the party to judge, or at least to leave siding with one.",
    solution: "Deliberately no 'correct' verdict. Good resolutions include: brokering a compromise (the farmer harvests deadfall/windfall only, the dryad allows one grove edge to be cleared), the party paying or working off the farmer's debt so he doesn't need the land, exposing that the deed itself is forged or outdated (only if players investigate), or simply picking a side and living with the NPC's reaction. The scene should reward listening and creative compromise over 'winning' an argument.",
    note: "Persuasion or Insight checks (DC 13-15) can reveal each party's genuine desperation/attachment rather than greed, deepening sympathy either way. If the party ignores both and leaves, have the conflict escalate offscreen (grove burned, or farmer's family driven off) as a consequence they hear about later. Reward for a real compromise: the dryad's blessing (advantage on saves vs. poison in her grove) or the farmer's lasting gratitude (a standing discount/ally in town)."

    solution: "The door opens for literally any honest answer, spoken with sincerity — 'treasure,' 'to save my friend,' 'I don't know, I'm just following the others.' The puzzle IS that there's no puzzle: it punishes players who try to game it with a 'clever' lie or an overthought riddle-answer instead of just answering the question asked. If someone answers dishonestly, the DM should know (via a subtle tell) but let it play out.",
    note: "No roll needed for a truthful answer — it simply opens. If a player answers with a deliberate lie, the door stays shut and a soft chime repeats the question once more, gently signaling 'try again, honestly' rather than punishing. This is a good palate-cleanser puzzle to place after a genuinely tricky one, so keep the reward modest but pleasant — a rest alcove or a minor blessing."

    title: "The Sphinx Who Asks What You Love",
    prompt: "A sphinx reclining atop a ruined library asks each party member in turn, 'What do you love most, and why does it matter?' She is not looking for a specific answer — she is judging the sincerity and self-knowledge in the reply. Refusing to answer, or giving a flippant non-answer, visibly disappoints her.",
    solution: "Every genuine answer should 'work' differently — the sphinx grants a boon tailored to what was shared (a character who says 'my sister' might get a vision of the sister's safety; one who says 'gold' might get an honest but cutting remark from the sphinx about it, plus a smaller reward). This is about character development, not a pass/fail gate. Let players roleplay their answers and treat all sincere answers as valid solutions with different flavors of reward.",
    note: "No check needed to answer, but an Insight check (DC 14) by the sphinx (rolled by the DM, secretly) determines whether she believes the answer is sincere. A dodge or lie gets a lukewarm, minor blessing instead of a strong one — not punishment, just a lesser reward. Consider giving mechanical boons like a single reroll token, temporary hit points, or a clue to a later puzzle."

I will know if you lie.' The other spectators (rest of the party) must wait outside a veil of shadow and cannot hear the confession — only see the arbiter's reaction.",
    solution: "The 'solution' is simply an honest, personal confession from the player — the DM should let this be genuinely improvised roleplay, even if the character's confession is mundane. This works whether the character confesses something dark (a killing, a betrayal) or something small but personally shameful (cowardice, abandoning a friend). The point is vulnerability, not severity.",
    note: "This should not use dice — it's a pure roleplay checkpoint. If a player is uncomfortable improvising a confession, let them describe it in the third person or keep it vague ('something involving my brother') and have the arbiter accept that as sufficient. On refusal to engage at all, the arbiter simply denies passage and the party must find another route (a longer, trap-filled side passage) — a complication, not a hard stop."

    prompt: "A jittery goblin peddler named Grum sets up a rickety stall in the middle of a corridor, blocking the way, insisting the party 'simply must' buy something before passing. He lies constantly and shamelessly about his wares' value and origin, but by an old goblin custom he's bound by, he cannot refuse a truly fair trade once one is offered.",
    solution: "There's no fixed 'correct' item to trade — the puzzle rewards players who actually negotiate and offer something Grum would find fair (which might be junk to them but precious to a goblin, like a shiny button, a joke well-told, or a story). Deception, Persuasion, or even honest haggling all work. The fun is in watching Grum squirm as his own rule forces him to accept a deal he doesn't want.",
    note: "Persuasion or Deception check DC 12 to get Grum to name a 'fair' price at all (he stalls otherwise); DC 15 to talk him down further. On a failed haggle, Grum still lets them pass but 'accidentally' pickpockets a minor item as they go by. A charmingly worthless trinket from Grum can double as a future plot hook or comic relief item."

    prompt: "A heavy iron door, animated with a crude carved face, refuses to open, grumbling that 'nobody appreciates a good door anymore' after centuries standing guard alone. It won't respond to force, threats, or magic — only to being genuinely and specifically complimented on its craftsmanship, service, or the fine job it's doing standing there.",
    solution: "Any sincere, specific compliment works — praising its hinges, its patience, its carving, its dedication to the job. Generic flattery ('nice door') gets a lukewarm response; specific, creative compliments delight it. This is a pure comedy beat with no wrong answer as long as the players engage in good faith.",
    note: "Persuasion check DC 10 for a generic compliment (door opens slowly, grudgingly), DC 15 for a genuinely creative one is not even necessary — let good roleplay auto-succeed and reserve the roll only if players try to fake it insincerely. Failure/insincerity makes the door slam shut and sulk for 10 minutes before trying again. A fun, low-stakes puzzle to lighten the mood."

There is time to save only one before the current sweeps them past the rocks.",
    solution: "No correct answer is intended — this is a genuine no-win choice meant to provoke real table discussion and consequence, not a puzzle with a hidden 'save both' solution (though a sufficiently creative plan, like a rope thrown to one while someone dives for the other, should be allowed if players think of it and can back it with checks). Whatever they choose, let it land emotionally and follow up on it later (grief, gratitude, a grudge from a bereaved family).",
    note: "If the party attempts to save both, require two separate checks (e.g., Athletics DC 16 and DC 16, made by two different characters simultaneously) — succeeding at both is possible but should feel like a genuine long shot. Failing either means that target is lost. This is a heavy scene; use sparingly and telegraph consequences honestly rather than fudging them."

Both watch the party's decision closely.",
    solution: "No single right answer — giving the beggar coin, reporting her for the reward, quietly slipping her money out of the clerk's sight, arguing with the clerk on her behalf, or ignoring both are all valid and should shape how NPCs treat the party later (the clerk's faction vs. the city's poor). Reward roleplay commitment over any 'optimal' choice.",
    note: "Insight DC 12 reveals the beggar is telling the truth about her children (she is). Persuasion DC 14 can get the clerk to look the other way if the party wants to help her without consequence. There's no wrong mechanical choice — but track the reputation consequence (a favor owed to the clerk's faction, or goodwill with the city's underclass) for future scenes."

The jailer, absent but leaving a note, insists she's a dangerous poisoner awaiting trial and warns not to trust anything she says.",
    solution: "Both could be telling a version of the truth (she might be guilty of a lesser crime than accused, or innocent of THIS crime but guilty of another), and the DM should be prepared to reveal whichever backstory best serves the campaign rather than treating this as a logic puzzle with a hidden 'gotcha' answer. Freeing her, leaving her, or investigating further before deciding are all legitimate paths.",
    note: "Insight check DC 15 gets a read on her sincerity (make the roll mean something regardless of her actual guilt — a skilled liar can still read as sincere). Investigation DC 13 elsewhere in the dungeon can turn up evidence supporting or complicating either story. If freed and she's guilty, that's an interesting complication, not a punishment for 'wrong' play — let it develop into a new plot thread."

    prompt: "An ancient throne room tests visitors with a floating crown that only settles on the head of someone who first admits, aloud, to a genuine failure or weakness — the room's magic detects false humility instantly and mocks it with hollow echoing laughter.",
    solution: "Any sincere admission of weakness or failure works, regardless of severity — a character can confess a battle they lost, a fear they carry, or a skill they lack. The point is genuine humility, not competitive one-upping of trauma. Multiple party members can attempt it if the first is rejected.",
    note: "No roll for a sincere confession — it should simply work through roleplay. If a player tries to fake humility with an obviously boastful 'failure' ('my only weakness is I'm too generous'), the room's magic calls it out with laughter and the crown refuses, costing the party a few minutes and some pride but nothing dangerous. Reward: the crown grants a minor boon (advantage on the next Persuasion or Leadership-type check) to whoever earns it."

    solution: "This is meant to unsettle rather than be solved cleverly — genuine engagement (naming a real memory, even a small one, and roleplaying the moment of loss) is the intended path. A party that finds another way across entirely (levitation, a bridge upstream, a different guide) has also 'solved' it by avoiding the toll, and that should be allowed and even quietly rewarded for cleverness.",
    note: "No check required if players engage honestly — treat the 'lost memory' as a light, reversible roleplay flourish (a detail their character can no longer quite recall) rather than a mechanical stat loss, unless your table wants higher stakes. If they find an alternate route, that's a valid win — consider a Perception or Investigation DC 14 to spot the alternate path in the first place."

    solution: "There's no puzzle-box answer — the resolution is roleplay: the party investigating enough to learn his story (or simply taking his word for it) and then sincerely acknowledging the wrong done to him. This can be done through a heartfelt apology on the village's behalf, a promise to clear his name/tell his story, or a small ritual of remembrance. Force (destroying the ghost) is also a valid, if darker, resolution some tables may choose.",
    note: "Investigation or History checks around the mill (DC 13) can uncover his story to make the acknowledgment feel earned rather than guessed. Persuasion/Insight aren't strictly required, but a DC 15 Persuasion check can shortcut the scene if players want to speed-run a heartfelt speech. Reward: the ghost's blessing (removes a curse on the mill, or grants a keepsake he was buried with) once he's finally at peace."

    title: "The Guard Who Offers to Look Away",
    prompt: "A tired city guard blocking a restricted archive quietly offers the party a deal: for a modest bribe, he'll 'step away for his break' and let them through without a report. He seems almost relieved to be asked — like he's done this before and it eases his conscience about being underpaid.",
    solution: "No trick here — bribing him works exactly as offered, and so does refusing and finding a legitimate way past (talking your way in, showing credentials, coming back with permission). The interesting choice is what it says about the party, and whether the guard remembers the favor (or the refusal) later.",
    note: "Persuasion or Deception DC 12 if the party wants to talk him into a bigger favor than just looking away (e.g., providing a cover story too). No roll needed for a straightforward bribe. If the party reports him instead of bribing him, that's also valid — it could earn official favor but cost them an ally later. Track this as a minor reputation thread."

    title: "The Grove That Gives to Givers",
    prompt: "A small woodland shrine holds a wishing pool that grants requests, but its water visibly dims each time someone asks for something without first leaving an offering. A carved sign, half-worn, seems to say something about generosity coming before asking.",
    solution: "The 'trick,' such as it is, is straightforward and not meant to be a gotcha: give something before asking, and the wish is granted more fully; ask first, and it's granted weakly or not at all. This rewards generosity as a value rather than testing logic — let players who give something meaningful (not just a coin) get a noticeably better outcome, and treat it as a values statement rather than a mechanical formula to be min-maxed.",
    note: "No check needed — action (giving first) determines outcome. A token offering (a copper coin) grants a minor, flavorful wish; a meaningful offering (a treasured item, real effort) grants something mechanically useful (a temporary buff, a clue, a minor magic trinket). This can be revisited later in the campaign as a recurring shrine."

    title: "The Pie Judged by Greed",
    prompt: "A jolly, slightly unhinged pastry spirit challenges the party to an eating contest for a magic pie, but reveals mid-bite that the pie punishes gluttony — each additional slice eaten purely out of greed (rather than hunger or politeness) causes mild, comedic magical side effects (the eater's voice becomes squeaky, their hair turns pie-crust gold, etc.).",
    solution: "This is a comedic riff on a values test — a character who takes one modest slice and stops is 'rewarded' with a clean, useful minor magic effect from the pie, while a character who gorges themselves for the fun of it gets increasingly silly curses. There's no wrong choice, just different flavors of consequence — let greedy players enjoy the chaos rather than treating it as a failure state.",
    note: "Constitution save DC 10 per extra slice beyond the first to avoid a new comedic side effect (all effects fade after a long rest, purely cosmetic/harmless). No roll needed for a single polite slice. Good comic-relief encounter to break tension after a heavy scene."

Cornered, it turns to face the party, placing itself between them and its young, clearly ready to die rather than retreat further.",
    solution: "Killing it, sparing it (letting it and its cubs go, perhaps in exchange for it ceding the territory or a treasure it's guarding), or even taking the cubs as a bargaining chip are all valid, morally loaded choices with no 'correct' answer built in. Consider having the choice echo later — a spared beast might aid the party in a future encounter, or a slain one's cubs might be found and raised by someone else entirely.",
    note: "An Animal Handling or Insight check DC 13 can reveal the creature would stand down permanently if the party backs off from the den, avoiding further combat. No check is needed to simply choose mercy or violence outright. Reward for sparing it: a future ally or a guide through its territory; reward for defeating it: whatever treasure it was guarding."

    prompt: "A merchant loudly accuses a ragged street child of stealing her ring right in front of the party, demanding they search the child or hand over 'justice' themselves. The child tearfully denies it, insisting they were just asking for spare coin. A small crowd is starting to gather and wants the party to act.",
    solution: "There's no built-in 'gotcha' — this can go multiple ways depending on investigation: the child may be innocent (the ring was dropped and lost, or someone else took it), guilty (desperate and telling a half-truth), or the merchant may even be lying to cause a scene. The DM should decide the 'truth' based on what makes the best story for this table rather than there being one hidden objectively correct outcome, and should let the party's approach (search, defend, pay the merchant off, investigate) shape the resolution.",
    note: "Investigation DC 12 finds the ring nearby if it was simply dropped; Insight DC 14 on either party gives a read on sincerity. If the party can't or don't investigate, a snap judgment (paying the merchant, or shielding the child) is equally valid — just have it affect reputation with the crowd/local watch afterward."

    prompt: "A weathered statue of a robed elder stands at a crossroads shrine, and a plaque explains it will answer exactly one honest question from the party — any question at all — but only if asked with genuine need, not idle curiosity. It seems to know the difference.",
    solution: "There's no logic trick — the intended solve is simply for the party to think carefully and ask something that actually matters to them (a real unanswered question in the campaign), rather than trying to game the wording for maximum info. Reward earnest, big-picture questions over 'gotcha' phrasing attempts; the statue can even refuse to answer a question asked purely to exploit its wording, gently redirecting the party.",
    note: "No roll needed for a sincere question — the DM should simply answer honestly and usefully, treating this as a free, guaranteed clue toward the campaign's next step. If the party wastes it on something trivial or manipulative, the statue answers literally and unhelpfully, and that's a fair, self-inflicted consequence rather than something to punish further."

Players in the EAST chamber see a stone wall carved with a grid of unlabeled symbols — no numbers, no key, nothing to translate them. Players in the WEST chamber find a leather ledger mapping each symbol to a number, but its pages are bound in reverse order (page 12 first, page 1 last) and must be read back-to-front to make sense. Neither group can see the other's material.",
    solution: "The west group must realize their ledger reads backwards and relay the symbol-to-number key verbally to the east group, who then apply it to the wall to spell out a numeric code (for a door, a lever sequence, or a lock). Success requires both groups describing what they see out loud to each other rather than one group just being told 'the answer.'",
    note: "No roll needed if communication is genuine and thorough. If a group tries to shortcut by describing vaguely, add an Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 13 to catch a misread symbol. On failure to catch a misread, the wrong code is entered and triggers a minor trap (a dart trap, DC 13 Dex save, 1d6 damage) rather than a hard lockout — the party can simply try again after."

Seated at a table, they alone can physically handle a set of small carved wooden tiles with raised bumps and grooves — the rest of the party can see the tiles' visual side (painted symbols) but are not allowed to touch them. The blindfolded player must describe the shapes and textures they feel; the sighted players must describe the colors/symbols they see, without either side seeing/feeling the other's information.",
    solution: "The tiles form pairs — a texture (felt) matches a specific painted symbol (seen) — but only when both descriptions are compared aloud can the party sort them correctly into a matching sequence for a locking mechanism. Neither role alone has enough information.",
    note: "No roll for correct communication. If the party rushes and mismatches a pair, allow it to simply be wrong and require redoing the sequence rather than a punishing trap — this puzzle is meant to be low-stakes and fun with the sensory role-play. A DC 12 group check (best of Perception/Investigation among the sighted players) can hurry things along if the table is stuck."

Only a character proficient with thieves' tools or trained in mechanisms (a Rogue, Artificer, or similar) can see, on close inspection, that four of the levers (not necessarily the same four) show fine tool-marks indicating they're rigged to a hidden secondary mechanism.",
    solution: "The magically-sensitive character and the mechanically-skilled character must compare notes out loud: levers that are BOTH magical and mechanically rigged are safe to pull (the magic and the rigging cancel each other's trap function), while levers with only one property are dangerous. This only works if both players describe their findings to each other rather than acting on their own information alone.",
    note: "Detect Magic (or equivalent) reveals the magical levers automatically. Investigation DC 14 (rogue/artificer) reveals the rigged ones. Pulling a mismatched lever triggers a loud alarm (no damage, but summons a wandering monster or alerts nearby guards) rather than instant harm — a real complication, not a dead end."

Neither player can see the other's pool.",
    solution: "By describing what they each see aloud — furniture positions, a fallen banner, a crack in the floor — the two players can spot what changed between the two time periods (an object moved, a passage collapsed and reopened elsewhere) and deduce the location of a hidden item or route that only makes sense by comparing 'before' and 'after.'",
    note: "No roll for the comparison itself if descriptions are thorough. If the players struggle to spot the difference from description alone, allow an Intelligence check DC 13 from either to nudge them toward the one key discrepancy. Reward: the discrepancy points to a hidden cache or shortcut past a later obstacle."

    prompt: "One player (or a small group) descends into a flooded, pitch-dark cistern alone and must communicate to the party waiting above via a rope tied to their waist — one tug, two tugs, a held tug, etc. — since shouting doesn't carry through the water and walls. The diver can feel underwater carvings and obstacles but cannot see or speak clearly; the surface team has a torn diagram of what the tug-code should mean but is missing the diagram's legend explaining which tug pattern means what.",
    solution: "The diver must feel out the shape of the submerged mechanism (a rotating valve, say) and report findings via an improvised or partially-known tug code, while the surface team, lacking the legend, must work out through trial and repetition (and the diver's patience) what each tug pattern is being used to mean. This rewards the two subgroups establishing their own working code live at the table, not decoding a pre-set answer.",
    note: "Athletics DC 12 for the diver to hold their breath/position long enough to work the mechanism; on failure, they must surface and try again (costing time, not harm, unless something else in the cistern is hunting — a good spot to add a mild environmental threat like a current or eel). No check needed for the communication puzzle itself — that's pure roleplay coordination."

Another player, blindfolded, stands nearby and can hear the chime-wall's tones clearly but cannot see the deafened player's gestures. The rest of the party can see and hear everything and must relay between the two.",
    solution: "The deafened player feels a rhythm through touch and must mime it (taps, hand claps) for the sighted party members to observe; the blindfolded player hears a melody and must hum or describe it aloud. The party in the middle must realize the rhythm (felt) and the melody (heard) are two halves of the same tune and combine them, then relay the completed pattern back to whichever character needs to reproduce it (e.g., knocking a rhythm on a door).",
    note: "Performance or Intelligence check DC 13 to accurately reproduce the combined pattern back on the door/mechanism once figured out. Getting the pattern wrong causes the chime-wall to reset and the puzzle to restart (a time cost, not damage) — consider adding a slow-filling water hazard in the room for light urgency."

Each half, held up, shows a reflection of a DIFFERENT hidden room elsewhere in the dungeon that neither player has physically visited — one shard shows a room with three unlit braziers, the other shows the same room's ceiling with a painted constellation. Neither player can see the other's half or the room in person yet.",
    solution: "By describing their separate reflections to each other and the party, the two players can deduce which real room the mirror is showing (matching landmarks) and figure out the correct order to light the braziers based on the constellation pattern shown only in the other shard — information from both halves is required to solve the brazier order once the party actually reaches that room.",
    note: "No roll for the description/comparison. Once in the actual room, lighting braziers in the wrong order (if the party guesses without comparing) causes a brief harmless flare and mild disorientation (disadvantage on the next check) rather than a hard fail — they can simply try again."

They must then describe what they saw to the rest of the party, who were waiting outside and saw nothing themselves, before sending the next player in for another 60-second look.",
    solution: "No single player retains the whole picture — the party must pool multiple relayed accounts (2-3 players taking turns entering and reporting back) to reconstruct the full room and solve the lever sequence together, cross-checking each other's memories for consistency and filling gaps.",
    note: "Have each entering player make a Wisdom (Perception) check DC 12 privately — on a low roll, have them misremember one small detail, creating a fun 'compare notes' moment where the party must reconcile conflicting reports. Getting the final lever sequence wrong triggers a loud but harmless magical chime and resets the room, costing time only."

A second player, browsing a nearby shelf, finds a dwarven runebook with translations for abstract runes (danger, safety, treasure, passage) but no pictures at all — and critically, half the runebook's pages are water-damaged and illegible, meaning that player is also missing information the first player might be able to fill in once they compare what they have.",
    solution: "Neither reference alone completes the puzzle. The party must physically bring the two players together (or relay descriptions if kept apart) to match remembered/described pictograms to runes, filling each other's gaps — the mural-reader can describe an image the runebook is missing translation for, while context from the runebook helps guess at pictograms whose meaning isn't obvious.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation or History) check DC 13 to make a confident final match once both sets of info are combined; without the check, allow the party to guess based on pure roleplay reasoning if their logic is sound. A wrong final guess triggers a minor curse or trap (e.g., a temporary -2 to one ability score until short rest) rather than anything severe."

Those on the LOWER floor can see a bank of unlabeled levers and a mechanism clearly, but the room is too dark down there to see anything happening above or make sense of what the shadows might mean.",
    solution: "The upper group must describe the shape/movement of the shadows they see (which correspond to which lever is currently active/moving below); the lower group, unable to see their own mechanism's effect from outside, needs that shadow-description to know which lever does what before committing to a full sequence.",
    note: "No roll needed for the communication itself. A Perception check DC 12 from the upper group helps them describe shadows more precisely if the table is struggling. Pulling levers blind without waiting for upper-gallery feedback can trigger the mechanism jamming, requiring a Strength check DC 14 to free it before trying again."

One tower has a large stone dial with numbers that needs to be set to unlock a bridge; the other tower has a scroll listing the correct numbers but written in a code that references landmarks only visible from the FIRST tower's vantage point.",
    solution: "The scroll-holding group must relay the code (via gestures, torch-flashes, or single shouted words across the gap) while the dial-operating group cross-references it against landmarks only they can see, working together across the distance to determine and set the correct number.",
    note: "No roll for successful signaling if the players roleplay the gesture/shouting exchange in good faith. If the table wants added tension, require a DC 12 group Perception check to correctly interpret a torch-signal at long range; a failed read sets the wrong number, causing the bridge to partially collapse into a safe-but-annoying detour rather than a fall."

Another player has a chart correlating flavors to alchemical runes but has never smelled or tasted the vials themselves and cannot identify which vial is which without the first player's description.",
    solution: "The blindfolded taster's sensory descriptions must be matched live against the chart-holder's rune key to correctly identify and combine the right vials into a working reagent/antidote — this only works through back-and-forth description, not either player acting alone.",
    note: "Constitution save DC 10 for the taster if any vial is mildly unpleasant (no real harm, just a comedic grimace or minor disadvantage on their next check). Wrong combinations produce a harmless but pungent smoke cloud (heavily obscured area for 1 minute) rather than poison, keeping this puzzle low-stakes and fun."

The rest of the party can see a matching (but currently unlit/dark) board across the room and must move actual mechanism-pieces based solely on the blindfolded player's verbal description, without being able to see the reference board themselves.",
    solution: "This requires the blindfolded player to accurately describe positions (using a grid system they invent together, like 'left corner, three up') and the sighted players to trust and translate that into physical moves on their own board — success means recreating the winning configuration entirely through verbal relay.",
    note: "No roll needed if description is careful; if the party is rushing, add an Intelligence check DC 12 for the blindfolded player to keep track of the full board without losing count. A miscommunicated position simply requires backtracking a move or two, not a punishing reset."

The rest of the party, in an adjoining room, can hear a faint, repeating melody through the walls but has no way to physically interact with the drums themselves.",
    solution: "The hearing party members must hum or tap out the melody they can hear for the deafened player to see/feel (via visible tapping, not speech), and the deafened player then reproduces that rhythm on the drums by feel and sight alone — neither role can complete the puzzle without the other's input.",
    note: "Performance check DC 12 for whichever player attempts to physically reproduce the final rhythm on the drums. A slightly wrong rhythm causes the drums to simply fall silent and require a restart rather than any punishment — treat repeated attempts as a fun, low-stakes rhythm game at the table."

    solution: "The three groups must reconvene and read their fragments aloud in sequence (they'll need to figure out the correct order, which may itself require comparing details like matching rhyme or numbering carved subtly into each fragment) to reconstruct the full riddle, then answer it together.",
    note: "Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 12 to notice the small ordering marks on each fragment if the party is stuck on sequencing.

    solution: "The rooftop player must describe the star patterns they see; the archive player cross-references those descriptions against their chart to determine the significance (e.g., which direction to travel, or which of several doors corresponds to the current season) — solving it requires both perspectives combined.",
    note: "No roll for the core communication.

Each has secretly been slipped a different half of a dinner invitation revealing a conspirator's identity — one half names a person, the other half names a deed — but reading either half aloud at the table would tip off the wrong people.",
    solution: "The two players must find a subtle, in-character way to communicate their halves without alerting the NPCs around them — passing a note, a coded toast, an excuse to swap seats, or simply speaking in a prearranged code the party invents on the spot — to piece together who did what before the feast ends.",
    note: "Deception or Sleight of Hand check DC 13 to pass information subtly without an NPC noticing; failure means a nearby guest overhears a fragment, creating a fun complication (the guest reacts oddly, or later gossips about what they half-heard) rather than blowing the whole scene."

    solution: "Group B must relay their inscription's rule to Group A, and then both groups must coordinate in real time — Group A pressing gems in one order while Group B presses the mirrored sequence in reverse — requiring constant back-and-forth communication (shouted through the door, or via a small grate) to stay synchronized.",
    note: "No roll needed if the groups coordinate well; if they rush without full communication, allow a DC 13 group check (average across both sides) to catch a timing mismatch.

    solution: "This is a straightforward but tension-filled directional relay — the sighted party must give precise, careful directions and the blindfolded player must follow them exactly and communicate back what they feel underfoot, catching any miscommunication before a wrong step is taken.",
    note: "No roll needed for correct directions given carefully. A rushed or vague direction can be adjudicated with a DC 12 group Perception/Investigation check to have the sighted group double-check their own callout before it's acted on.

Reward: the compartment holds a minor magic item tied to music (e.g., a charm that grants advantage on the next Performance-based check)."

    title: "The Chest With No Visible Lock",
    prompt: "An iron-bound chest sits in the open, apparently unlocked, but any attempt to lift the lid without first disabling a nearly invisible trigger plate beneath the hinges releases a cloud of sleep-inducing spores.",
    solution: "A Rogue (or any character with Expertise in Investigation or a high passive Perception) notices the almost imperceptible seam of the trigger plate on close inspection and can disable it with thieves' tools before opening the chest safely.",
    note: "Gate: Rogue Expertise / high Investigation or Perception. Fallback: any character can attempt a flat Investigation check DC 18 to spot the trigger without expertise, or simply open the chest blind and make a group Constitution save DC 13 to resist the sleep spores (unconscious for 1 minute, no lasting harm, but noisy and vulnerable). Reward: whatever treasure the chest holds, undiminished either way — the gate only affects whether the party takes the spore hit."

    title: "The Fox That Knows the Way",
    prompt: "A small, unnervingly patient fox has been trailing the party through a maze of ruined hedgerows, occasionally chittering and darting toward one path over another, clearly trying to communicate something it knows about the safe route.",
    solution: "A character who casts Speak with Animals (or has an innate ability to communicate with beasts, like a Ranger's companion bond or a Druid's Wild Shape empathy) can simply ask the fox, which will happily explain the safe path and warn of a nearby pit trap in exchange for a bit of food.",
    note: "Gate: Speak with Animals spell (or equivalent). Fallback: without it, a character can attempt an Animal Handling check DC 15 to interpret the fox's body language well enough to follow its general direction (not full detail — they'll still need a Perception check DC 13 to spot the pit trap themselves). Reward: a faster, safer route through the maze, or a following animal companion for the rest of the dungeon if treated kindly."

    title: "The Row of Identical Idols",
    prompt: "Twelve identical stone idols line a hallway, and legend (or a helpfully ominous plaque) says only one is truly enchanted and will react if touched correctly, while the other eleven are inert decoys — visually indistinguishable from one another.",
    solution: "A character who casts Detect Magic instantly sees which idol radiates an aura, saving significant time and risk. Without it, the party must resort to trial and error or careful physical inspection.",
    note: "Gate: Detect Magic spell (or an item/ability that senses magic, like a Paladin's Divine Sense for divine auras). Fallback: an Investigation check DC 16 per idol (tedious but doable) to spot subtly different wear patterns on the true idol's base, or simply touching each idol in turn and making a Dexterity save DC 12 to avoid a minor jolt of magical feedback (1d4 damage) from the eleven decoys before finding the real one. Reward: the true idol yields a minor blessing or unlocks a hidden passage."

    prompt: "An ancient stone tablet is covered in flowing script no one in the party recognizes, but it's clearly instructions of some kind — possibly the key to disarming the guardian construct standing silent nearby.",
    solution: "A character who casts Comprehend Languages (or has a racial/background trait granting broad language comprehension) reads the tablet immediately and learns the construct's shutdown phrase.",
    note: "Gate: Comprehend Languages spell or similar. Fallback: the party can seek out a scholar or linguist NPC back in town (costing time and possibly a fee), or attempt a slow Intelligence (History) check DC 18 to puzzle out enough of the script through comparative linguistics (representing a long, careful study session, at least 1 hour in-game). Reward: knowing the shutdown phrase avoids a dangerous fight with the guardian construct entirely."

    prompt: "A narrow ventilation grate leads to a shortcut past a sealed portcullis, but the opening is barely a foot and a half wide — plainly too small for most adventurers to squeeze through, no matter how they contort.",
    solution: "A Small-sized character (Halfling, Gnome, or similar) fits through with relative ease, popping out the other side to open the portcullis manually for the rest of the party.",
    note: "Gate: Small size (Halfling, Gnome, or a Medium character under a size-reduction effect). Fallback: a Reduce spell (or similar effect) shrinks a Medium character to fit; alternatively, the party can find the long way around (extra time, likely another encounter) or attempt to force the portcullis open directly with a Strength check DC 20 (or DC 15 with proper tools/leverage like a crowbar). Reward: the shortcut saves significant time and bypasses whatever guards or hazards the long way holds."

    title: "The Sheer Cliff Face",
    prompt: "A smooth, near-vertical cliff face rises above a chasm, with a small ledge visible near the top holding a glinting object, but there are no obvious handholds for most climbers.",
    solution: "A character with an innate climbing speed (Tabaxi, certain other races, or a Barbarian/Monk with relevant features) scales the cliff quickly and safely, retrieving the object without much difficulty.",
    note: "Gate: innate climbing speed. Fallback: any character can attempt the climb with rope and pitons via a Strength (Athletics) check DC 17 (reduced to DC 13 with proper climbing gear), with a fall (1d6 per 10 feet, capped reasonably) as the consequence of failure rather than instant death — or the party can find another route with a Perception check DC 14 to spot a longer but safer path. Reward: the object is a minor magic item or a useful map fragment visible only from that ledge."

    title: "The Seam in the Stonework",
    prompt: "A section of dungeon wall looks like solid, unremarkable stone to most, but conceals a secret door blended seamlessly into the natural rock — the kind of craftsmanship only a keen eye for stonework would ever catch.",
    solution: "A Dwarf (with Stonecunning) automatically notices the unnatural seam and slightly-too-perfect joins in the stonework, recognizing it as worked stone rather than natural rock, and can locate the trigger mechanism easily.",
    note: "Gate: Dwarf Stonecunning (or similar stone-sense trait). Fallback: a non-Dwarf character can attempt an Investigation or Perception check DC 17 to notice the same details without the racial bonus, or simply search the wall systematically (10 minutes per 10-foot section) for a passive chance to notice it. Reward: the secret door leads to a shortcut or a hidden treasure room bypassing a guarded route."

    prompt: "A spectral guardian in an enchanted garden speaks in a hypnotic, honeyed voice, attempting to charm whoever listens into wandering off a cliff edge 'to see something beautiful.' Its magic is subtle and insidious.",
    solution: "A character with Fey Ancestry (Elves, Half-Elves) or another form of charm immunity/advantage shrugs off the effect entirely or resists it easily, and can then warn/protect the rest of the party from the guardian's influence.",
    note: "Gate: Fey Ancestry or charm resistance/immunity. Fallback: any character can attempt a Wisdom saving throw DC 15 against the charm effect; on a failure, they begin walking toward the cliff edge but a party member can attempt a Strength check DC 10 to physically restrain them (no damage, just a scare) before real danger. Reward: safely dealing with the guardian reveals a peaceful garden shrine and a minor restorative boon."

    title: "The Clockwork Puzzle-Box",
    prompt: "A intricate brass puzzle-box, covered in tiny interlocking gears and dials, is rumored to contain a valuable component inside — but its mechanism is far more delicate and complex than a simple lock, clearly built by a master tinkerer.",
    solution: "A character with tinker's tools proficiency (Gnomes, Artificers, or anyone trained) can methodically work through the gear sequence, understanding the mechanical logic well enough to open it safely and without damaging the contents.",
    note: "Gate: tinker's tools proficiency / Artificer-type expertise. Fallback: without proficiency, a character can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 17 to reason through the mechanism by trial and observation, or simply force the box open with a Strength check DC 15 — success still gets the contents, but a forced opening has a 50% chance of slightly damaging whatever's inside (reducing a magic item's charges by one, for example). Reward: a valuable clockwork component or small magic item."

    title: "The Boulder-Sealed Passage",
    prompt: "A massive boulder blocks a narrow passage, clearly too heavy for ordinary effort to move — but scorch marks and old rope fragments nearby suggest others have tried and failed before the party arrived.",
    solution: "A character with exceptional raw strength (a raging Barbarian, or anyone benefiting from a strength-boosting feature/spell) can shove the boulder aside with a single mighty effort, especially if raging removes the need for a particularly high roll.",
    note: "Gate: high Strength / Barbarian Rage or similar. Fallback: the party can rig a pulley-and-lever system (requiring rope, a sturdy branch or pole, and an hour of setup) to reduce the effective DC, or have multiple characters combine efforts on a group Strength check DC 20 (each contributing, with the highest roller leading). Reward: the passage leads to a shortcut or an unlooted side-chamber."

  {
    title: "The Chasm of Uncertain Footing",
    prompt: "A wide chasm splits the dungeon corridor, its far ledge crumbling and uneven, with no clear way across except a running leap that would challenge even a skilled athlete — and a fall means a long drop onto jagged rocks below.",
    solution: "A Monk (with their enhanced jump distance and Slow Fall feature as a safety net) crosses with relative ease and confidence, able to recover gracefully even from a stumble.",
    note: "Gate: Monk class features (jump distance / Slow Fall) or similar mobility feature. Fallback: any character can attempt a Strength (Athletics) check DC 15 to make the jump, with a failed check resulting in a fall arrested by a rope tied off beforehand (if the party thinks to prepare one) — otherwise 2d6 fall damage and a Dexterity save DC 13 to avoid injuring an ankle (disadvantage on movement-related checks for the next hour). A Feather Fall or Jump spell also trivializes the crossing. Reward: the far side holds a shrine or cache inaccessible any other way."

    title: "The Pit With No Bridge",
    prompt: "A deep pit separates the party from a lever on a small central pillar rising from its depths, with no visible bridge, stair, or rope — just open air between the party and their goal.",
    solution: "A character capable of flight (Aarakocra, a Fly spell, a broom or magic item) simply flies over, pulls the lever, and returns without needing to solve the pit at all.",
    note: "Gate: flight (racial or spell). Fallback: the party can rig a rope-and-grapple crossing (Athletics DC 14 to secure the throw, then DC 12 to traverse), or use a Spider Climb / Feather Fall combination if available, or find a longer stair passage elsewhere in the dungeon (extra time, likely another minor encounter). Reward: the lever opens a shortcut door, saving significant backtracking."

    title: "The Trial of Endurance",
    prompt: "An ancient trial chamber floods with searing steam and demands whoever stands within endure its punishing heat for several long minutes without flinching or fleeing, as a test of resolve before a sealed door will open.",
    solution: "A character with exceptional constitution or an endurance-related racial trait (like a Half-Orc's Relentless Endurance, or simply a very high Constitution save) can outlast the trial with relative ease, enduring the punishment that would fell a less hardy soul.",
    note: "Gate: high Constitution / endurance traits. Fallback: any character can attempt the trial with a Constitution saving throw DC 16 each minute (up to 3 rounds), taking 1d8 fire damage on each failure but not being ejected unless they choose to flee; alternatively, the party can share the burden by having multiple characters take shorter turns, or use Resistance to fire (a spell or potion) to trivialize it. Reward: the sealed door opens to reveal a trial-reward chamber with a magic item suited to fortitude (e.g., a ring of Constitution-related benefit)."

    prompt: "A tight, twisting drainage tunnel offers a shortcut beneath a guarded checkpoint, but it's barely wide enough for a large housecat to squeeze through — plainly impassable for anyone in their normal form.",
    solution: "A Druid using Wild Shape to become a small animal (a rat, weasel, or similar) can slip through easily, scout ahead, and potentially unlock or unbar the door on the far side from the inside.",
    note: "Gate: Druid Wild Shape (small form) or a Find Familiar-type scouting option. Fallback: without Wild Shape, the party can send a purchased/summoned small creature (a hired guide's ferret, a Tiny familiar from another class, or a captured local critter) through instead, or bypass the checkpoint entirely with a Stealth-focused approach (group Stealth check DC 15) past the guards. Reward: bypassing the checkpoint avoids a difficult guard encounter entirely."

  {
    title: "The Room of Absolute Dark",
    prompt: "A chamber is filled with unnatural, magical darkness that swallows even normal darkvision, leaving most parties completely blind and disoriented as something unseen shuffles nearby.",
    solution: "A character with an ability to see through magical darkness (a Warlock's Devil's Sight invocation, or similar) can navigate and act normally in the room, spotting the threat and guiding the rest of the party or dealing with it directly.",
    note: "Gate: Devil's Sight (Warlock invocation) or equivalent magical darkness-piercing sight. Fallback: the party can retreat and use a Daylight spell or similar to counter the magical darkness (if available), or navigate blind via careful, slow movement (half speed, Perception checks DC 15 to avoid bumping hazards) while relying on hearing and touch. Reward: whatever lurks in the dark is dealt with (or avoided) without a dangerous blind melee."

  {
    title: "The Forgotten Ritual Circle",
    prompt: "A dormant ritual circle glows faintly on the floor of a temple chamber, clearly still active in some way, and touching it carelessly risks triggering an effect no one currently understands.",
    solution: "A character proficient in Religion or History (or a Cleric/Paladin with relevant domain knowledge) recognizes the ritual's purpose and safe activation method from its iconography, allowing the party to use or disarm it correctly.",
    note: "Gate: History or Religion proficiency. Fallback: without proficiency, the party can spend time researching (an hour with a relevant book, if one's available, or consulting an NPC scholar back in town), or simply test the circle cautiously — stepping on an edge tile first and making a Wisdom saving throw DC 13 to resist a minor disorienting effect (no lasting harm) before understanding it through trial and error. Reward: safe use of the circle grants a blessing, teleportation shortcut, or reveals hidden lore relevant to the campaign."

    title: "The Mirror of Many Faces",
    prompt: "A hall of illusions presents the party with what appears to be five identical robed figures, one of which is a genuine fiendish infiltrator and the rest harmless magical projections — all outwardly indistinguishable.",
    solution: "A Paladin using Divine Sense immediately detects the presence of the one genuine fiend among the illusions, cutting straight through the deception without needing to interact with any of them directly.",
    note: "Gate: Paladin's Divine Sense (or similar fiend/undead detection). Fallback: without it, the party can attempt to interact with each figure — illusions won't respond consistently to touch or complex questions (Investigation check DC 14 per figure to notice inconsistent reactions), or the party can simply attack all five (illusions harmlessly wink out when struck, wasting a turn but revealing the real target). Reward: identifying the fiend quickly avoids a drawn-out fight against illusions wasting the party's resources."

    title: "The Wrong-Way Shadows",
    prompt: "Torches line both walls of this corridor, burning steady and yellow — but every shadow they throw, including your own, leans toward the north wall no matter where you stand. At the far end, a sunlit archway seems to open onto a garden beyond. The light from it never flickers with the torches.",
    solution: "The archway is a Silent Image (or similar minor illusion) masking solid stone; the real exit is a section of the north wall that looks blank but conceals a door. The illusion-caster never accounted for the room's actual light sources, so every shadow in the room — including the party's — is being pulled unnaturally toward the wall that's hiding something, instead of falling naturally away from the torches. The garden light also never wavers, unlike true torchlight.",
    note: "Investigation or Perception DC 13 to consciously clock the shadow inconsistency; anyone who says they're checking how the shadows fall gets it free. Walking into the fake archway just means walking into a wall (no damage, a faint mocking laugh). Reward: a small gem cache or a spell scroll behind the real door."

    title: "The Room That Echoes Bigger",
    prompt: "This chamber is small — you can cross it in six steps — but when you speak, your voice comes back off the walls a half-second too late, like it's bouncing through a much larger space. A single flat wall of undressed stone shows no seams, cracks, or mortar lines anywhere.",
    solution: "The 'small chamber' is itself an illusion (a Silent Image or similar magical overlay) laid across the entrance of a genuinely much larger vault beyond. The echo timing is the one thing the illusion doesn't fake, because it's a passive magical effect over sight, not sound — the true acoustics of the real, larger space leak through. Touching or pushing through the flat wall reveals it's not there at all.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to notice the echo doesn't match the room's apparent size (a character with the Search action or who claps/shouts to test the room gets advantage). Walking confidently at the wall passes through harmlessly; walking timidly just bonks a nose. Reward: the true vault beyond holds the session's next tier of loot."

    title: "The Painted Door",
    prompt: "At the end of a dead-end hallway is a heavy iron-banded door, perfectly detailed down to the rust streaks and a keyhole — except it never opens, no matter what key or spell you try. Nearby, a much plainer stretch of bare wall has a single faint smudge of a footprint on the floor in front of it, as if someone stood there recently and simply vanished.",
    solution: "The 'iron door' is a masterwork trompe l'oeil mural, painted with such care that even the rust looks three-dimensional — but it's flat, and no amount of magic opens a door that was never a door. The real secret door is the plain wall with the footprint in front of it; the smudge is a genuine physical clue (someone used it recently) rather than anything magical.",
    note: "Investigation DC 14 to notice the painted door has no shadow gap under it and doesn't sound hollow when knocked on, versus the plain wall which does. Spending several minutes fruitlessly trying to pick/force the painted door just wastes time (maybe triggers a random encounter check). Reward: the hidden door leads to a supply cache or shortcut past a guarded area."

    title: "The Almost-Repeating Floor",
    prompt: "The floor of this hall is tiled in a checkered spiral pattern that seems to repeat every few feet — but a careful look shows one row near the middle is subtly off, the spiral's curve breaking and restarting a half-inch out of alignment before continuing as if nothing happened.",
    solution: "The misaligned row marks the safe path across a floor that is otherwise rigged with pressure plates keyed to the 'correct' spiral pattern. Whoever built this trap assumed no one would notice a tiling flaw; the row where the pattern breaks is the only line of tiles NOT wired to the trap, because the mason had to leave it as a maintenance access seam.",
    note: "Investigation DC 15 to spot the misalignment without being told to look for it; DC 10 if a player specifically says they're studying the floor pattern. Stepping on a live tile triggers a loud but non-lethal alarm-chime trap (no damage, alerts nearby monsters) rather than anything deadly. Reward: minor treasure in an alcove past the hall, plus avoiding the encounter the alarm would have caused."

    title: "The Hall of Mirrors",
    prompt: "This octagonal chamber is lined floor to ceiling with age-spotted mirrors, multiplying your torchlight into a dizzying maze of reflections. Somewhere among the eight mirrored walls is the actual exit corridor, but every panel looks identical at a glance. One reflection, if you look closely, never quite matches your movements.",
    solution: "One of the eight 'mirrors' is not a mirror at all but an open corridor dressed with a painted frame and glass-effect lacquer to blend in; forced perspective and the dazzle of the real mirrors around it hide the difference. The giveaway is that the false mirror's 'reflection' doesn't perfectly mirror the party's motion — a step forward doesn't bring the reflected party proportionally closer the way it does in the true mirrors.",
    note: "Perception DC 14, or automatic if a player tosses a coin/pebble at each panel and listens for the one that doesn't ring like glass. Walking into a true mirror just means a bruised nose and a wasted round. Reward: nothing fancy needed here — getting through efficiently avoids a wandering monster check."

    title: "The Backward Stair",
    prompt: "A spiral staircase corkscrews downward into darkness. Descending feels ordinary enough, but any character who turns around to go back up finds the stairs somehow leading further down instead, no matter how many turns they climb.",
    solution: "The staircase is built with a masonic trick used by paranoid architects: the steps are subtly wedge-shaped and the spiral's pitch is engineered so that walking 'up' the way you came actually continues you further along the same downward spiral, just from a different visual angle — there is no magic involved, only architecture. The only way to actually reverse course is to count steps aloud and physically retrace the exact number climbed, moving in exact lockstep rather than trusting your sense of 'up'.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to realize the stair keeps a suspiciously constant width and pitch that never varies as a real staircase's would over multiple flights. A wrong attempt just costs time and a few extra levels of pointless descent, not damage. Reward: none required — this is a pacing/navigation puzzle, but a side passage near the bottom can hold a minor cache as a consolation for the trouble."

    title: "The Glittering Vault",
    prompt: "Through an open doorway you see a small chamber heaped with gold coins, spilling almost to the threshold. It gleams invitingly in your torchlight. To one side, nearly hidden behind a support pillar, sits a plain, unremarkable wooden chest with a simple clasp.",
    solution: "The gold pile is a Major Image (or similar) illusion draped over a floor rigged to collapse into a spike pit the instant real weight is put on it — the trap-makers wanted the obvious, greedy choice to be the lethal one. The genuine treasure, considerably more modest looking, is in the plain wooden chest, which nobody bothers to loot on their way to the 'real' prize.",
    note: "Investigation or Insight DC 13 — the gold pile never shifts, clinks, or catches light exactly the way loose coin should, and no coins have spilled onto the floor outside the doorway despite the overflowing pile. Stepping onto the illusory gold triggers a fall onto a padded/net-lined pit below rather than spikes if you want a softer consequence (DM's call on lethality) — recommend 2d6 falling damage and a Strength check to climb out, not instant death. Reward: the plain chest holds real, if modest, treasure — reward the players who checked it first."

    solution: "'She' is a doppelganger, or an illusion/disguise spell cast by something that wants the party led deeper into a trap, and it doesn't actually have perfect knowledge of the dungeon — it's improvising based on what it can observe of the party's reactions. The mismatch between her claimed familiarity and her actual, slightly-wrong recall is the tell.",
    note: "Insight DC 14 to catch the inconsistency in her story, or automatic if a player directly cross-examines her about a specific detail from an earlier room. If unmasked, she panics and either flees or attacks rather than being an unbeatable threat — treat as a normal doppelganger/spy encounter, not an ambush kill. Reward: information about the dungeon's real layout, pried from her before she flees, or her employer's identity."

    title: "The Blind Gallery",
    prompt: "The moment you enter this long gallery, your torches gutter out and refuse to relight — the darkness here is absolute and unnatural. As you stand still, you notice the space doesn't feel empty: your own breathing and footsteps come back to you off close walls in some directions, and off open air in others.",
    solution: "The room is under a permanent magical darkness effect, but it's a straightforward navigation puzzle solvable by sound alone: clapping, tapping a staff, or speaking and listening to the echo reveals which directions are open passage and which are solid wall, guiding the party to the true exit without sight. There is no visual solution to find here — leaning on Perception (sight) instead of the room's actual sonic cues is the trap.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 (using hearing, not sight — call this out if a player insists on trying to see) to map the room by sound within a few rounds. A wrong turn just means bumping into a wall and having to reorient, no damage. Reward: a hidden alcove partway through the gallery, findable only by noticing a spot where echoes come back oddly hollow, containing a small magic item."

    title: "The Wall of Cold Fire",
    prompt: "A wall of orange flame roars silently across the corridor ahead, licking at the ceiling and radiating a flickering orange glow across your faces — but as you get closer, you realize you feel no heat at all, even standing right beside it.",
    solution: "The fire is a Major Image illusion (sound suppressed or simply flavor-omitted by the caster) meant to bar the corridor to anyone who doesn't investigate closely; it has no substance and can be walked straight through. It exists purely to turn back parties who don't test what's actually in front of them.",
    note: "Investigation DC 10 for anyone who gets within 10 feet and pays attention to the lack of heat, crackling sound, or smoke smell — this one should be easy to catch if players engage with their senses at all. Walking through does nothing but look silly in front of the flames. Reward: none required, but consider a short passage of story/lore revealed on the far side that justified guarding it in the first place."

  {
    title: "The Silent Statues",
    prompt: "A colonnade of a dozen identical stone guardians lines this hall, each carved mid-stride with a raised spear. Your torchlight throws long shadows from most of them across the floor — but one, near the hall's center, casts no shadow at all.",
    solution: "Eleven of the statues are ordinary stone; the twelfth is a real, animated guardian (or a creature disguised as a statue) that the illusion of 'just another statue' relies on around it, but true stone always casts a shadow and this one, being a creature rather than an object under the room's lighting rules, subtly doesn't — or its shadow flickers independently when it shifts weight, however slightly, waiting to strike.",
    note: "Perception DC 15 to notice the missing/wrong shadow before it acts; alternatively the guardian gets a surprise round against anyone who walks past it without noticing. Frame the guardian as a warning/gatekeeper rather than an assassin — it can be reasoned with, bypassed with the right token or password, or fought as a normal encounter rather than an ambush kill. Reward: the guardian, once dealt with or satisfied, permits passage to a warded chamber beyond."

    title: "The Twin Doors",
    prompt: "Two identical oak doors stand side by side at the corridor's end, both banded in the same tarnished bronze, both slightly ajar. A thin ribbon tied to a wall sconce between them flutters gently — but only toward one of the two doors.",
    solution: "One door is a Silent Image dressing an actual dead-end alcove (a trap meant to waste time or trigger a nearby ambush), and the other leads onward. The fluttering ribbon reveals which door has real air moving through it from the passage beyond — illusions don't generate airflow, so the door the ribbon leans toward is the true one.",
    note: "Investigation DC 11 to notice the ribbon's consistent lean, or automatic if a player thinks to test airflow (a held-up feather, licked finger, or lit match works too). Opening the false door just reveals a shallow illusory alcove, wasting a round, sometimes with a minor trap or noise-maker set to alert nearby monsters. Reward: efficient choice avoids the wandering monster check tied to the wasted time."

  {
    title: "The Portrait That Speaks",
    prompt: "A life-sized portrait of a stern old wizard hangs in this study, and as you approach, its painted lips move, greeting you by name and offering cryptic warnings about the dungeon ahead. Its voice seems to come from everywhere in the room at once, oddly.",
    solution: "The portrait itself is inert; the voice is being thrown via ventriloquism or a speaking tube by someone (a hidden servant, spy, or minor spellcaster) concealed behind the wall or in an adjoining room, watching through the portrait's eyeholes. The 'voice from everywhere' is the tell — a truly animated or magically speaking portrait would have its voice clearly originate from the painting, not diffuse oddly through the room.",
    note: "Insight or Investigation DC 13 to notice the voice's source doesn't quite track to the painting's mouth, or DC 15 Perception to hear faint shuffling/breathing behind the wall during a pause in the 'portrait's' speech. If confronted, the hidden speaker is a normal NPC (informant, spy, bored apprentice) rather than a monster — this is a roleplay/information encounter, not a fight. Reward: whatever information or bargain the hidden speaker is willing to offer once caught."

    title: "The Mirror Pool",
    prompt: "A still, circular pool of dark water sits in the center of this round chamber. Looking into it, you see your own reflection standing in a room that looks almost right — except the reflected room has a second doorway on its far wall that isn't anywhere in the actual room around you.",
    solution: "The pool is enchanted to show the room's true, unconcealed layout rather than a normal reflection; the extra doorway visible in the water is real, hidden behind an illusory wall panel in the actual room that the party can't see just by looking around normally. Checking the pool's reflection is the intended (and fair) way to spot the hidden exit.",
    note: "No check needed if a player looks into the pool and describes examining the reflection carefully; otherwise Perception DC 12 to notice the reflection doesn't quite match the room. There's no failure state here beyond not noticing — the pool is calm and non-hazardous. Reward: the hidden door leads to the chamber's real prize, rather than the pool being a red herring."

    title: "The Leaning Candle Flames",
    prompt: "A row of identical candle sconces lines this hallway, each flame burning straight and still except for two, near a section of blank wall, which lean consistently toward that wall as if pulled by an unseen draft.",
    solution: "The leaning flames are being pulled by air moving through a hidden door or passage behind that section of wall — a purely physical, mundane clue rather than anything magical, easily missed by parties who don't pay attention to their surroundings once they've decided a stretch of hallway is 'nothing.'",
    note: "Perception DC 11 to notice the leaning flames, especially if a player says they're checking the candles or torches as they pass. There's no punishment for missing it — the party simply continues on and may need to backtrack later. Reward: a shortcut or bypass around a later obstacle, if found."

    title: "The Bridge That Isn't Broken",
    prompt: "A stone bridge spans a deep chasm ahead, but halfway across, a wide gap yawns where the bridge appears to have crumbled away entirely, stone chunks visibly tumbled into the darkness below. There's no way across... except the wind doesn't seem to be blowing through the gap the way it should for an open chasm.",
    solution: "The gap is a Major Image illusion over a perfectly intact section of bridge, designed to make cautious parties turn back or waste resources finding another way around. The mismatch between the visual 'open chasm' and the lack of expected wind, echo, or falling debris sound is the fair clue that it isn't real.",
    note: "Investigation or Perception DC 13 to notice the sensory mismatch; alternatively, tossing a pebble into the 'gap' and hearing it clatter on solid stone rather than falling is an easy, player-generated solution worth rewarding automatically. Refusing to cross costs time (and possibly a wandering monster check) but nothing worse. Reward: crossing directly saves significant time versus finding an alternate route."

    title: "The Tunnel That Caved In",
    prompt: "The passage ahead is choked with rubble, ceiling beams sagging, dust still hanging in the air as if the collapse just happened — yet your torch flame doesn't flicker or dim in the supposedly dust-thick air, and no new dust settles on your boots as you approach.",
    solution: "The 'cave-in' is an illusion meant to turn parties back toward a different, trapped route the dungeon's builders actually wanted intruders to take. The absence of dust in the air affecting torchlight or settling on the party is the tell — real settling dust from a fresh collapse would be thick enough to see drifting and would coat anything that walked through it.",
    note: "Investigation DC 14, or automatic for a player who explicitly tests the rubble by touch (their hand passes through, or the debris feels wrong/insubstantial). Wasting time trying to dig through triggers a wandering monster check but nothing worse. Reward: bypassing it also means bypassing whatever trap the illusion was steering the party toward instead."

    title: "The Weeping Prisoner",
    prompt: "Chained in an alcove, a ragged figure begs for release, sobbing that they've been trapped here for weeks and know a safe way out if you'll just free them. Their story is compelling and their fear seems genuine — but they cast no reflection in the small puddle of water pooling near their chains.",
    solution: "The 'prisoner' is a hag, fey, or other shapechanging predator using an illusory guise to lure the party into freeing and trusting it, at which point it leads them into a genuine trap or attacks once vulnerable. The missing reflection is a classic, fair tell for illusion/glamour magic. The real prisoner, if there is one, is elsewhere in the dungeon and can be found through other clues.",
    note: "Perception DC 15 to notice the missing reflection, or Insight DC 13 if the character presses the 'prisoner' with pointed questions that don't quite add up. If unmasked before being freed, the creature can flee or negotiate rather than immediately fighting — don't make this an automatic ambush. Reward: information about the dungeon (if talked down) or standard treasure if defeated."

    title: "The Endless Hallway Mural",
    prompt: "This hallway seems to stretch on and on, torch-lit sconces receding into the distance — but as you walk, the far end never seems to get any closer, and the sconces never actually flicker or cast new shadows as you pass them.",
    solution: "The 'continuing hallway' beyond a certain point is a forced-perspective mural painted directly onto a flat end wall, expertly shrinking in scale to fool the eye at a glance. The real exit is a side door, easy to miss because attention is drawn forward down the false corridor rather than to the sides.",
    note: "Investigation DC 13 to notice the sconces never actually illuminate anything as the party 'passes' them, or to notice brushstrokes up close once within a few feet of the wall. No danger in walking into it beyond a bruised pride. Reward: the true side door, once found, leads onward without further delay — a time-saved reward is enough here."

  {
    title: "The Hum in the Floor",
    prompt: "Thick, unnatural fog fills this low chamber, reducing visibility to a few feet in any direction. Standing still, you can feel a faint, rhythmic vibration through the soles of your boots, coming from somewhere beneath the floor.",
    solution: "Visibility is deliberately useless here — the room is meant to be solved by touch. The vibration leads to a hidden floor panel concealing a lever or mechanism (tied to a nearby water wheel, bellows, or clockwork device) that, when found and pulled, clears the fog or opens the true exit. Players relying only on sight-based checks will flounder; those who describe feeling along the floor succeed.",
    note: "No roll needed if a player explicitly gets down and feels along the floor for the vibration's source; otherwise Perception DC 14 (allow advantage for anyone kneeling or crawling). Wasting time swinging blindly at fog does nothing but waste a round. Reward: the mechanism, once triggered, also disarms a minor trap elsewhere tied to the same fog generator."

    title: "The Pendulum Corridor",
    prompt: "Three massive stone pendulums swing across this corridor at staggered intervals, blunted enough not to be lethal but heavy enough to knock a person flat. Watching for a full cycle reveals the rhythm — but it takes patience to time a run all the way through.",
    solution: "The pendulums swing on a fixed, unchanging rhythm (suggest an 18-second cycle with a 4-second safe gap for each). Getting struck simply knocks the character prone and slides them back to the corridor's entrance — no damage, just a reset. Players who count beats or assign someone to watch and call timing can pass safely once they've observed one full cycle.",
    note: "Reward Investigation/Perception DC 10 checks with an early read on the pattern, but let any party simply watching for a full cycle figure it out without rolling. Getting hit deals no damage (or trivial 1 HP for the sting) and resets the character to the entrance; other party members' progress is unaffected. Reward: a small cache of alchemical supplies in a niche near the corridor's midpoint, only reachable by pausing there mid-pattern."

  {
    title: "The Watching Statues",
    prompt: "Stone sentries line this gallery, spears crossed to bar the way — but each time you look away, or so it seems, their positions have subtly shifted, as if they only move when unobserved. Getting caught mid-motion by a returning gaze causes the nearest statue to seize the offender and hurl them bodily back to the gallery entrance.",
    solution: "The statues genuinely only move when no one is looking directly at them (magically animated, tied to line of sight rather than distance). The party must coordinate so someone is always watching a given statue while others advance past ones no one is looking at, essentially playing 'Red Light, Green Light' in reverse. Progress isn't retained on a catch — the caught character is simply returned to the start, unharmed, and must try again with the knowledge gained.",
    note: "No roll needed to understand the rule once a player observes it happen once (make this explicit and fair — call out the shift after their first turned back). Being caught means a shove back to the entrance, no damage, just wasted time. Reward: at the gallery's end, a shrine offers a minor blessing to the first character through unassisted."

  {
    title: "The Sweeping Beacon",
    prompt: "A brilliant magical light rotates slowly around this circular vault like a lighthouse beam, sweeping every few seconds. Standing in its beam sets off a blaring alarm that summons the vault's guardians — but stepping into shadow the instant before it passes keeps you hidden.",
    solution: "The beam completes a full rotation every 12 seconds (2 rounds), sweeping a 90-degree arc each pass. Getting caught in the light doesn't harm anyone or force a full reset — it simply triggers guardians to investigate the vault for several rounds, and the party keeps whatever progress they'd made (they just need to hide and wait it out, or fight the guardians if caught in the open). Careful timing lets the party avoid the alarm's attention entirely.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to accurately predict the beam's next sweep after watching one rotation. A triggered alarm summons 1d4 guardians (scale to party level) rather than an instant failure state — a fair fight or a stealth recovery, not a game over. Reward: bypassing the beam entirely, alarm-free, grants a bonus — perhaps a surprise round against the vault's actual occupant, or extra time before a later deadline."

    title: "The Shifting Gas Vents",
    prompt: "Vents in the walls of this narrow passage hiss open at intervals, releasing puffs of thick, sleep-inducing gas that drift across the corridor before dissipating. The timing feels familiar at first — but each time the vents cycle, the gap between eruptions is subtly different than the last.",
    solution: "The vents are on a semi-randomized magical timer that shifts slightly every cycle (rather than a fixed rhythm), meaning memorizing one 'safe count' won't reliably work twice. Success requires watching the vents actively each time and reacting to the current cycle rather than relying purely on rote memorization — rewarding players who stay engaged with the room instead of just running the previously 'solved' pattern.",
    note: "Perception DC 13 each attempt to read the current cycle's timing (rather than a single check that solves it forever). Breathing gas causes a short, harmless sleep (1 minute, no damage) and the sleeping character is gently deposited back at the passage's entrance by a magical current in the floor. Reward: a satchel of alchemical reagents at the passage's far end, undisturbed because most who pass through never notice it in their hurry."

  {
    title: "The Realigning Platforms",
    prompt: "A series of stone platforms hover over a bottomless-seeming shaft, drifting and rotating into new configurations every few moments. Reaching the far side means leaping from platform to platform as they align — and any platform you've successfully stood on locks in place once you've cleared it, no longer drifting.",
    solution: "Each platform, once successfully used as a stepping stone, magically anchors in its current position, meaning the puzzle gets progressively easier as the party advances — later attempts (or later party members) benefit from the platforms already secured by those who went first. A fall just triggers a Feather Fall-enchanted safety net effect built into the shaft, gently returning the faller to the starting ledge with no damage.",
    note: "Athletics/Acrobatics DC 12 per leap, with disadvantage if attempting without having watched at least one full drift cycle. Falling triggers the automatic safety effect (no damage, no roll needed) and returns the character to the start, but any platforms already anchored by earlier successes stay anchored. Reward: a chest embedded in the far wall, visible only once the shaft is fully crossed and lit properly."

    title: "The Flooding Chamber",
    prompt: "Water begins pouring into this sealed chamber the moment the door shuts behind you, rising steadily. A row of levers along one wall, each marked with a different rune, must be pulled in some order to open the exit — but the water reaches the ceiling well before you can test them all thoughtfully.",
    solution: "The correct lever sequence is written, in a language the party may need to translate, on a plaque half-submerged near the floor — visible only once the water is high enough to swim down and read it, rewarding players who explore rather than panic. If the water reaches the top before the sequence is solved, the door simply unseals automatically (a safety failsafe) and drains the room, resetting the puzzle but costing time and requiring the party to re-enter.",
    note: "Investigation DC 12 to spot the submerged plaque once the water is deep enough; the sequence is a genuine, fair clue rather than a guess. A failed attempt costs a lever-pull (with a brief harmless jolt of static from a wrong pull) but the flooding/drain-and-reset cycle means no permanent danger of drowning if the DM telegraphs the failsafe clearly. Reward: the exit, once opened correctly, also reveals a alcove with minor treasure that only appears once the water fully drains."
  },
  {
    title: "The Clockwork Patrol",
    prompt: "Two suits of animated armor march fixed routes through this intersection of corridors, crossing paths every so often but never quite colliding. Slipping past unseen requires timing your movement to the gaps in their patrol — but you notice that after each full circuit, one of the two guards pauses a beat longer than before, as if slowly winding down.",
    solution: "The patrol pattern isn't perfectly static: one construct's clockwork mechanism is gradually running slower, meaning the safe window to slip past grows slightly with each cycle. Parties who wait and observe multiple cycles get an easier crossing than those who rush the first attempt — rewarding patience over a single memorized 'solution.'",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to time a crossing correctly; being spotted triggers a brief, non-lethal grapple/shove from the construct that ejects the character back to the intersection's entrance (no damage, might make noise that risks a wandering monster check). Reward: past the intersection, a supply room the constructs are guarding holds useful consumables."

  {
    title: "The Drumbeat Floor",
    prompt: "This tiled room hums with a steady drumbeat that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere. Certain tiles glow faintly in time with the beat; stepping on a glowing tile in rhythm is safe, but stepping out of time triggers a small jolt of force that knocks you back a few tiles.",
    solution: "The safe path is literally choreographed to the drumbeat, meant to be learned by ear and rhythm rather than sight alone — deaf or non-hearing characters (or a Silence spell cast carelessly) would need an alternate method, like counting a visible flicker in the glow instead. Getting bumped only sends the character back a short distance within the room, not all the way to the start, preserving progress made toward the far side.",
    note: "Performance or Perception DC 11 to internalize the rhythm after one failed attempt (advantage on subsequent tries once the pattern's been experienced once). A wrong step costs a few tiles of backward progress and a mildly startling jolt (no damage). Reward: a ceremonial drum at the room's center, a minor magic item that lets its bearer always sense rhythm-based traps in the future."
  },
  {
    title: "The Spinning Spike Pillars",
    prompt: "In this circular chamber, four stone pillars bristling with dulled iron spikes rotate slowly around a central dais, sweeping close to the walls on each pass. Reaching the dais means timing a dash between rotations — and the spikes, while blunted enough not to kill, will absolutely knock the wind out of anyone caught.",
    solution: "The pillars rotate at a steady, learnable rhythm (suggest a 4-count cycle with a brief gap every fourth beat). A hit deals no real damage but knocks the character prone and pushes them back toward the chamber's outer wall, effectively resetting their approach without harming them. The rhythm is consistent throughout, rewarding players who count beats and coordinate a dash together.",
    note: "No check strictly required if the party watches and counts; otherwise Perception DC 10 to catch the rhythm faster. A hit is 1 damage (flavor: bruising, not real harm) plus a shove back to the wall. Reward: the dais holds a minor magic item or a lever that stops the pillars permanently for the rest of the dungeon, a nice quality-of-life reward for solving it once."

    title: "The Duel That Never Ends",
    prompt: "A ghostly image of two duelists replays over and over in this hall, locked in the same exchange of blows — advance, parry, advance, and always the same fatal thrust at the same moment. Somewhere in that repeating memory, one duelist drops a key that skitters across the floor and vanishes when the loop resets.",
    solution: "The vision is a residual haunting, not a threat — it can't actually harm the party. Timing an intervention to grab the key at the exact moment it's dropped (just before the fatal thrust, when the losing duelist's hand opens) yields the real, physical key, which persists in the material world even after the vision resets. A mistimed grab just means waiting for the loop to restart, no penalty beyond lost time.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to catch the precise moment the key drops on the first viewing (advantage on subsequent loops once players know what to watch for). No danger from a failed attempt — the vision can't harm the living. Reward: the key opens a locked door elsewhere tied to this hall's history, likely holding treasure or lore relevant to the duelists' story."

  {
    title: "The Alternating Vents",
    prompt: "Floor vents around this chamber alternate between gouts of flame and blasts of biting frost, roughly in time with glowing runes set into the floor that flicker between red and blue. Standing on a rune matching the room's current 'safe' element keeps you unharmed; standing on the mismatched one stings badly.",
    solution: "The safe rune color alternates on a readable timer synced to the vents (red runes are safe during the fire phase, blue during frost, and vice versa is dangerous). The pattern is consistent and learnable by watching a cycle, but crossing the room requires hopping between rune tiles as the phase changes, since no single tile stays safe the whole way across.",
    note: "Perception DC 11 to read the sync between runes and vents after observing one cycle. A mistimed step deals minor fire/cold damage (1d4, non-lethal) and staggers the character back to the room's entrance. Reward: the far wall holds a sconce with a permanently lit variant of one of the runes, a minor trinket useful for a later fire- or cold-related trap elsewhere."
  },
  {
    title: "The Crumbling Checkerboard",
    prompt: "The floor of this chamber is a checkerboard of stone tiles, and every few seconds, one tile at random crumbles away and reforms a moment later. Crossing safely means reading which tiles are about to give and avoiding them — or reacting fast enough to leap clear if you're standing on one when it starts to crack.",
    solution: "Tiles telegraph their coming collapse with a visible spiderweb of cracks a full second before crumbling, giving attentive players fair warning. Falling through isn't lethal — beneath the floor is a padded catch-pit with a ladder leading back up to the chamber's entrance, meaning a fall costs time and dignity but no real harm.",
    note: "Perception DC 10 to notice the crack-warning in time to react; Dexterity save DC 12 to leap clear once cracking starts. A fall deals no damage (soft landing) and requires climbing the ladder back up, effectively a reset for that character alone while others may continue. Reward: a chest bolted to the chamber's far wall, reachable only once the party learns to read the tile-cracking pattern reliably."
  },
  {
    title: "The Bell Choir",
    prompt: "Six bronze bells hang from the ceiling of this round chamber, each connected to a pull-cord. A hidden mechanism rings them in a specific sequence once, then falls silent, waiting for the sequence to be repeated correctly. Get it wrong, and the bells reset — but you notice the demonstrated sequence isn't quite the same the second time it plays.",
    solution: "The 'lesson' sequence changes slightly each time the mechanism demonstrates it (say, cycling through three related but distinct patterns), meaning brute-force memorization of one sequence won't work forever — the party needs to watch and repeat whichever sequence was just shown, staying attentive rather than assuming a single fixed answer. This discourages splitting the party to 'divide and conquer' by memory alone.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to accurately recall the just-demonstrated sequence (advantage if a player is specifically designated to watch and count). A wrong sequence just resets the demonstration and mutes the bells for a few seconds before trying again — no damage, no lockout. Reward: a correct sequence causes a hidden panel to open, revealing a small shrine offering a temporary blessing (advantage on the next saving throw, or similar)."

  {
    title: "The Levitating Stepping Stones",
    prompt: "Flat stone discs hover in a loose line across this chasm, rising and sinking gently like they're breathing. Some are at a walkable height only briefly before dipping below reach; timing a crossing means watching the rhythm of the rise and fall.",
    solution: "Each disc rises to a crossable height on its own independent, slow cycle, meaning the safe path across shifts constantly rather than being a fixed sequence — success is about reading the current state of the stones in the moment rather than memorizing a single 'correct' order. A misstep just means stepping onto empty air where a disc has dipped, triggering a soft-landing enchantment (a cushioning rune network below) that gently deposits the faller back on the starting ledge.",
    note: "Acrobatics DC 12 for a well-timed leap; Perception DC 10 to read a disc's current rhythm before committing. A fall triggers the cushioning effect (no damage) and returns the character to the start ledge. Reward: the far ledge holds a small cairn with a minor magic trinket left by a previous, more careful traveler."

    title: "The Blunted Turret Gallery",
    prompt: "Wall-mounted crossbow turrets line this long gallery, firing padded bolts at intervals down its length. Getting struck doesn't wound so much as it startles and shoves — but the turrets seem to fire in a rotating sequence rather than all at once, and standing in the wrong alcove at the wrong moment is uncomfortable rather than dangerous.",
    solution: "The turrets fire in a fixed rotating order (turret 1, then 2, then 3, repeating), with alcoves along the gallery offering brief cover between shots. A hit only pushes the character back a few feet and costs a few seconds recovering, rather than sending them all the way back to the start — this puzzle is meant to be forgiving enough that a party can push through with minor setbacks rather than needing a perfect run.",
    note: "No formal check needed to learn the rotation after witnessing one full cycle; Dexterity save DC 10 to avoid a shove-back if caught in the open when a turret fires. Being hit is 1 damage (bruising) plus a few feet of lost ground, not a hard reset. Reward: the gallery's far end holds the turret control mechanism, which can be jammed to disable the trap permanently for later trips."

    title: "The Scent-Blind Hounds",
    prompt: "Spectral hounds patrol this passage, noses low, hunting by scent rather than sight. A row of wind chimes along the ceiling stirs occasionally, masking sound and scent alike whenever a faint breeze rolls through — the hounds pause and sniff the air in confusion each time the chimes ring.",
    solution: "The hounds can be evaded by timing movement to the intermittent chime-triggering breeze (on a semi-regular but not perfectly fixed interval, encouraging active attention rather than rote counting). Being noticed doesn't provoke an attack — the hounds are guardians meant to escort intruders back out, not kill them, so a 'failure' here simply means being firmly, harmlessly herded back to the passage's entrance.",
    note: "Stealth DC 13 to move during a masking breeze, or Perception DC 11 to correctly predict the next gust after observing a couple of cycles. Being caught means an escort back to the start (no damage, mildly embarrassing). Reward: successfully slipping past reveals the hounds are guarding a den with a resting, non-hostile creature willing to trade information or an item for being left in peace."

  {
    title: "The Turning Garden Maze",
    prompt: "A hedge-and-statue garden maze fills this courtyard, and every few minutes, a great stone dial beneath the central fountain grinds and rotates several of the hedge-walls into new configurations. Once a path segment has been crossed and the party has passed a small waystone marker along it, that segment seems to lock in place regardless of the dial's later turns.",
    solution: "Waystone markers, scattered at intervals through the maze, anchor whatever path configuration is active when a character passes them, meaning earlier progress isn't lost to later rotations — the maze becomes progressively 'solved' as the party advances rather than resetting punishingly. This lets the party push forward incrementally across multiple attempts rather than starting over each time the dial turns.",
    note: "Survival or Investigation DC 12 to navigate confidently between rotations; no penalty for being caught mid-rotation beyond needing to wait out the current shift before continuing. Reward: the maze's center holds a fountain blessed with a minor boon (a free short rest's worth of healing, or similar) for whoever reaches it."

    prompt: "A deep gong echoes through this sloped tunnel every so often, and moments after each toll, a rumble of loose stone comes cascading down from side passages above, sweeping across the tunnel floor. Alcoves are cut into the walls at intervals, just large enough to duck into.",
    solution: "The gong is a reliable warning cue — the rockslide always follows a set number of seconds after the toll, giving attentive players fair time to reach the nearest alcove. The 'rocks' are enchanted to be more startling than dangerous (a safety measure built by whoever uses this passage regularly), dealing minor bruising damage and knocking a caught character back to the last alcove they successfully reached rather than all the way to the tunnel's start.",
    note: "Perception DC 10 to catch the gong as a warning cue; Dexterity save DC 12 to reach cover in time. A failed save deals 1d4 damage and repositions the character to their last-cleared alcove, preserving partial progress. Reward: a niche near the tunnel's end, only reachable by ducking into every alcove along the way, holds a stash left by a previous cautious traveler."

    prompt: "A spectral figure relives its final moments in this chamber over and over — reaching for a fallen sword, calling out a name, and fading just before its hand closes on the hilt. Each time, the vision resets and begins again from the start.",
    solution: "The spirit is stuck in a loop of unfinished business; interacting at the right moment (offering the sword, speaking the name it calls, or simply providing what it reaches for) breaks the pattern and lets the vision resolve differently, granting the party its blessing or a key it was guarding. A mistimed or wrong interaction just causes the vision to reset and start over — no harm, just another chance to get it right, and each viewing gives more context about what the spirit actually needs.",
    note: "Insight DC 13 to piece together what the spirit is failing to complete after watching it loop at least once. A failed attempt to help simply restarts the vision with no consequence. Reward: successfully resolving the spirit's memory grants a permanent boon to the character who helped (advantage on a specific save type, or a whispered piece of dungeon lore) plus whatever physical item the vision was tied to."

    title: "The Four Braziers",
    prompt: "Four unlit braziers stand in this square chamber, and a brief flash of ghostly flame flickers across them in a specific order the instant you enter, then dies. Lighting the real braziers in that same order should open the far door — but if you get it wrong, all four braziers douse with a puff of smoke and a mild static shock.",
    solution: "The order shown in the initial flash is the genuine, fair answer — meant to be memorized on the spot, and it doesn't change between attempts, rewarding a party member who watches carefully at the start. A wrong sequence doesn't punish position or progress; the party stays exactly where they are and can simply try again once the smoke clears, with no penalty beyond time.",
    note: "Perception DC 12 to catch the initial flash-sequence clearly (advantage if a player specifically says they're watching closely from the start). A wrong attempt douses all braziers and delivers a harmless static shock (no damage, just startling) before resetting for another try. Reward: lighting it correctly opens the door and leaves one brazier permanently lit with a everburning flame, useful as a light source later."

    title: "The Lightest Stone",
    prompt: "A row of pressure plates sits before a sealed gate, each meant to hold a weight from a nearby pile of stones. Every other pressure-plate puzzle you've faced in this dungeon so far has demanded the heaviest stone available to force the mechanism. This time, the inscription above the gate simply reads: 'Only a feather may pass.'",
    solution: "This gate wants the lightest possible weight — an actual feather, an empty hand, or the smallest pebble nearby — rather than the heaviest stone the party has been trained to reach for by every previous plate in the dungeon. Placing a heavy stone here jams the mechanism (harmlessly) rather than opening it.",
    note: "Use this kind of reversal sparingly — once, maybe twice, per dungeon. It only lands if you've clearly established 'heaviest stone wins' as the pattern in at least two earlier pressure-plate rooms first; without that setup this is just an arbitrary gotcha, not a twist. A wrong (heavy) attempt jams the plate and swings out a counterweight arm — one real, telegraphed swing (1d6 bludgeoning, easy to see coming and dodge) before it resets. Reward: a lightweight trinket behind the gate — a feather token that casts Feather Fall once per day, fittingly."

    prompt: "A series of engraved dials on this vault door must be turned to align a set of symbols — and by now, your party has learned that every lock you've faced in this dungeon turns clockwise to open. This final dial resists turning clockwise entirely, but gives slightly when nudged the other way.",
    solution: "This particular lock was installed by a different, more paranoid hand than the rest of the dungeon's builders, specifically turning counter-clockwise as a deliberate security measure against thieves who'd learned the dungeon's usual convention. Turning it the 'wrong' way is correct here.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon at most. This only works as a twist if you've established 'clockwise opens locks' clearly across at least two or three earlier locked doors/vaults; otherwise it's just an unfair guess. Forcing it clockwise hard enough snaps a hidden pin, meaning the party now has to break the vault open the hard way (DC 15 Strength or Thieves' Tools) instead of solving it cleanly. Reward: a genuinely better haul than the dungeon's other locked doors — real coin and at least one magic item, undamaged only if the dial was solved rather than forced."

This time, after posing its riddle, the guardian falls silent and simply waits, watching you expectantly, as if speaking the answer isn't what it wants at all.",
    solution: "This guardian wants to be asked a question in return, not given an answer — it's testing curiosity rather than knowledge, subverting the 'answer promptly' habit the previous two guardians trained into the party. Asking it a genuine question (about itself, the dungeon, or the riddle) is what actually satisfies it and opens the way.",
    note: "Use this kind of reversal sparingly — once per dungeon, twice at the absolute most. It only lands as a twist if you've established at least two prior riddle-guardians that reward a direct spoken answer; otherwise players have no reasonable basis to expect anything different. Speaking a straight answer here doesn't punish the party — the guardian just tilts its head and repeats itself, waiting, rather than doing anything harmful. Reward: a genuine question earns passage plus a small relic the guardian has kept for whoever finally asked right, worth looting."

    solution: "Someone altered this particular dial specifically to punish parties running on autopilot from earlier 'highest number wins' rooms — the correct setting here is zero (or the lowest available value), the opposite of what every prior dial has trained the party to reach for.",
    note: "Use sparingly — this should appear once, maybe twice, per dungeon at most, or it teaches players to distrust every dial and stops feeling clever. It only works if 'turn to the highest number' has been clearly established across at least two earlier dial puzzles. Setting it to the highest number ejects the dial's counterweights outward in a short, telegraphed burst (DC 12 Dexterity save or 1d4 bludgeoning) before resetting for another attempt. Reward: correctly reading the altered dial pops open a stash the dungeon's builders hid specifically from copycat thieves — real coin and a minor magic trinket."

    title: "The Honest Red Door",
    prompt: "Throughout this dungeon, red-painted doors have consistently marked danger (trapped rooms, guarded vaults) while blue doors have marked safe passage — a pattern you've now relied on several times. Here, a red door and a blue door stand side by side, but the blue door's paint looks suspiciously fresh, as if recently redone.",
    solution: "A trickster (or the dungeon's original owner, wary of intruders who'd catch on to the color code) repainted the doors here specifically to invert the established pattern: the red door is actually safe, and the freshly-painted blue door is the trap. The telltale fresh paint is the fair clue that something's been tampered with.",
    note: "Use this sparingly — once per dungeon at most, and only after the red/blue safety convention has been clearly and consistently established across at least two or three earlier door choices; otherwise this just feels like an arbitrary punishment for trusting established rules. Opening the trapped blue door triggers a minor, survivable trap (a dart, a puff of stinking gas — nothing lethal) rather than serious harm. Reward: the red door leads to a room the dungeon's users specifically wanted overlooked, containing better-than-usual loot."

    title: "The Smaller Flask",
    prompt: "Two potions sit on a pedestal: a large, ornately corked flask brimming with glowing liquid, and a small, plain vial with barely a mouthful inside. Every alchemical choice you've faced in this dungeon so far has rewarded picking the larger, more impressive-looking option.",
    solution: "The large flask is a decoy — showy but inert or even mildly harmful (a sleeping draught, a weak poison) — while the unassuming small vial holds the genuinely potent potion. This subverts the 'bigger is better' assumption the dungeon's earlier alchemy puzzles trained into the party.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only lands if 'the bigger/showier option is correct' has been established across at least two earlier choices; without that setup it's just a coin flip dressed up as a puzzle. Drinking the large flask causes a real, if temporary, setback — disadvantage on attacks and checks for 10 minutes as the sleeping draught takes hold. Reward: the small vial is a genuine combat potion (a real healing or damage-boosting effect), worth finding and drinking correctly."

  {
    title: "The Descending Stair",
    prompt: "At three points earlier in this dungeon, choosing to climb upward at a fork has always led to treasure or safe passage, while descending led to danger or dead ends. At this fork, a faint draft of fresh, cool air rises from the downward stair — air that shouldn't exist if it only led to a dead end.",
    solution: "This time the treasure and the true path both lie below, not above — the 'always go up' pattern from earlier forks was true for this dungeon's upper levels but doesn't hold once the party reaches its lower foundations, which connect to natural caverns rather than the built structure above. The fresh air is a genuine, fair clue that the downward path leads somewhere real.",
    note: "Use this kind of reversal sparingly — once per dungeon. It only works as a twist if 'up is safe/good' has been clearly reinforced across at least two or three earlier forks; otherwise it reads as arbitrary. Choosing to go up wastes real time doubling back through unstable, previously-explored passages, risking a wandering-monster check along the way. Reward: the downward stair leads to the dungeon's true final chamber — the session's best loot waits there."

  {
    title: "The Servant's Greeting",
    prompt: "A row of statues depicting a noble household stands in this hall — a lord, a knight, a scholar, and, at the end, a simple servant carrying a tray. Every ritual you've performed in this dungeon so far has required addressing or greeting the highest-ranking figure present first.",
    solution: "This hall inverts the expectation: the household actually wants visitors to greet the servant first, out of respect for the person who did the real work keeping the household running — a value the family apparently held dear, subverting the 'greet the most important-looking one' instinct built up by earlier rituals.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon at most. This only lands if 'address the highest-ranking figure first' has been established through at least two earlier ritual or greeting puzzles; without that setup it's an arbitrary guess dressed as lore. Greeting the lord or knight first visibly offends the household spirits bound in the statues, animating them for one short, fair fight (a weak, telegraphed encounter) before the ritual can be reattempted properly. Reward: greeting the servant first unlocks a hidden compartment in the statue's tray — a real keepsake and a key worth taking."
  },
  {
    title: "The Even Lever",
    prompt: "A bank of eleven numbered levers lines this wall. In two earlier rooms, pulling any odd-numbered lever safely triggered the intended mechanism, while even-numbered levers were trapped — a pattern you've come to rely on. Here, a small brass plaque beside the levers reads 'Maintenance Access — Reversed Wiring,' half-covered in dust.",
    solution: "This particular bank was rewired at some point (as the half-hidden plaque genuinely warns, if noticed), inverting the odd/even safety pattern from earlier rooms — here, the even-numbered levers are safe and the odd ones are trapped. The plaque is a fair, findable clue that something about this room's wiring differs from the others.",
    note: "Use this reversal sparingly — once per dungeon. It only works if the odd/even safety pattern has been clearly established across at least two earlier lever rooms, and the maintenance plaque here must be genuinely noticeable (not hidden behind an unreasonable check) for the twist to feel fair rather than a gotcha. Investigation DC 12 to spot and read the dusty plaque before pulling anything. Pulling a wrong (trapped) lever delivers a real if minor shock (DC 12 Constitution save or 1d4 lightning damage). Reward: correctly reading the room grants safe access to whatever the levers control — a genuine cache, plus the satisfaction of catching the dungeon's inconsistency."

    title: "The False Trail of Motes",
    prompt: "A trail of soft, glowing motes drifts through the air ahead, and in two previous chambers, following such a trail led safely to the exit. Here, the motes drift invitingly toward a shadowed archway — but the floor beneath them is scuffed with old claw marks, and no motes drift anywhere else in the room.",
    solution: "These motes are being deliberately generated by something lurking beyond the archway (a predator or trap-rigger that has learned intruders follow the dungeon's usual light-motes) to lure prey into a killing ground, inverting the 'glowing motes mean safety' pattern from earlier rooms. The claw marks are the fair, physical clue that something dangerous uses this route regularly.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only works if glowing motes have been established as a safe/reliable trail-marker in at least two earlier rooms; otherwise this just punishes normal exploration. Investigation or Survival DC 13 to notice the claw marks and the motes' unnaturally narrow, single-purpose drift. Walking into the archway triggers a fair, telegraphed combat encounter rather than an ambush kill (give the party a chance to notice something's wrong just inside the doorway before anything attacks). Reward: the true safe path, once found by ignoring the motes, is marked by a genuinely subtle but honest clue (a worn handrail, old boot-scuffs) leading the correct way."

    title: "The Whispered Answer",
    prompt: "A booming stone guardian has, twice now, rewarded the party for shouting their answers boldly and confidently to its riddles, its voice approving of conviction. This time, after posing its question, it leans in close and murmurs, 'This is not a hall for shouting.'",
    solution: "This guardian explicitly signals the change itself — it wants the answer whispered or spoken quietly this time, valuing discretion over the confidence the earlier guardians rewarded. This is a fair subversion specifically because the guardian tells the party outright that the old approach won't work here, rather than silently punishing them for guessing wrong.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This lands well specifically because the guardian gives a direct, in-fiction hint about the change; without a clear signal like this, don't invert the expected behavior. Shouting the answer here simply causes the guardian to shake its head and repeat the question rather than punishing the party — allow another attempt. Reward: a correctly whispered answer grants passage plus a quiet word of genuine, useful advice from the guardian."

  {
    title: "The Unbalanced Scale",
    prompt: "A great stone scale straddles the doorway ahead, and in every previous weighing-room in this dungeon, placing equal weight on both sides was the key to opening the way forward. This scale is engraved with two words above its pans: 'Mercy' and 'Justice' — and it will not balance no matter what you place on it.",
    solution: "This scale isn't meant to be balanced at all — it's a values test, not an arithmetic one, and it wants deliberate imbalance in favor of whichever virtue the dungeon's builders (or the story established earlier) actually prized, likely 'Mercy' outweighing 'Justice' or vice versa depending on the campaign's established themes. Trying to force equal weight, the pattern from earlier rooms, never triggers anything.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only lands if 'balance both sides equally' has been clearly established as the solution in at least two earlier weighing puzzles, and if the campaign has given some earlier hint (an NPC's story, an inscription) about which virtue this dungeon's builders valued more. Failing to balance it simply does nothing — no trap, just a door that won't open — so players can experiment freely. Reward: correctly weighting the scale reveals it was a values test all along, and the door beyond holds a reward thematically tied to whichever virtue won."
  },
  {
    title: "The Names, Not Numbers",
    prompt: "Floor tiles numbered one through twelve have, twice before, needed to be crossed in strict ascending numerical order to avoid triggering a trap. This chamber's tiles bear no numbers at all — only names, matching a memorial plaque the party passed several rooms back.",
    solution: "This room drops the numeric convention entirely and instead wants the tiles crossed in the order the names appear on that earlier memorial plaque — a detail only available to parties who actually read and remembered it. This isn't a trap for trap's sake; it rewards attention paid to lore and detail rather than pattern-matching on 'find the ascending sequence' from the earlier number rooms.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only works fairly if the party had a genuine, undisguised opportunity to read that memorial plaque earlier (make sure it was presented clearly, not buried in an obscure check), and if 'cross tiles in ascending numeric order' was clearly established beforehand. A wrong tile order triggers a minor, survivable jolt trap and resets the tiles rather than causing serious harm. Reward: crossing correctly triggers a respectful chime and opens the way, sometimes with a small tribute reward left for those who honor the names."

  {
    title: "The Tarnished Key",
    prompt: "A ring of keys hangs by this chest, ranging from an enormous, gleaming ceremonial key down to a small, tarnished, unremarkable one. Every locked chest you've opened in this dungeon so far has responded to the largest, most impressive-looking key on hand.",
    solution: "This chest's lock is worn smooth and only accepts the small, tarnished key — an old working key actually used by the household, as opposed to the larger ceremonial keys that were always more decorative than functional in the dungeon's earlier chests. The subversion rewards players who examine rather than assume based on size and shine.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only lands as a twist if 'biggest/showiest key opens the chest' has been established across at least two earlier locked chests; otherwise it's an arbitrary guess. Trying the large key just doesn't fit or turn — no trap, no penalty, try again. Reward: this chest, guarded by an unassuming lock, holds notably better treasure than the more ornate chests the party has already opened."
  },
  {
    title: "The Untrustworthy Reflection",
    prompt: "In an earlier chamber, a pair of doors flanked a mirror, and choosing the door matching your mirrored reflection's side was the correct, safe choice. Here, a similar mirror hangs between two more doors — but its surface is subtly warped, rippling faintly even when nothing moves in front of it.",
    solution: "This mirror is cursed or enchanted to show a reversed, false reflection, meaning the door that matches the reflection here is actually the trapped one — the party needs to choose the door that does NOT match what the warped mirror shows, inverting the rule the earlier, honest mirror taught them. The visibly rippling, imperfect surface is the fair clue that this mirror can't be trusted the same way.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only works if an earlier, trustworthy mirror-and-doors puzzle has clearly established 'match the reflection' as correct; otherwise there's no convention to subvert. Investigation or Perception DC 13 to notice the mirror's surface is subtly wrong (rippling, warped, or slightly delayed) compared to the earlier one. Choosing the matching door here triggers a minor, telegraphed trap (a puff of gas, a startling noise) rather than serious harm. Reward: the correct, non-matching door leads onward without incident, plus the curious detail rewards players who investigate rather than pattern-match on autopilot."
  },
  {
    title: "The Anti-Key Symbols",
    prompt: "A combination lock on this vault has, in earlier rooms, always opened when its dial was turned to match a set of symbols shown on a nearby plaque. Here, the plaque's symbols are etched with a small skull in the corner, and the vault's designer apparently had a taste for irony.",
    solution: "This vault was deliberately built to punish thieves who'd cracked the dungeon's earlier combination-matching convention — the correct solution is to dial in the exact opposite (mirror-image or inverse) of the symbols shown, not the symbols themselves. The skull icon is a genuine, if grim, warning for those who know to look for it.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only lands if 'match the shown symbols exactly' has been clearly established across at least two earlier combination locks; otherwise it's an unfair guess. Investigation DC 13 to notice the skull icon and consider that it's a deliberate warning rather than decoration. Dialing in the matching (expected) symbols trips a real alarm that summons a guard patrol — a genuine encounter, not just noise. Reward: this vault, built specifically to deter the dungeon's usual thieves, holds a noticeably better prize than its counterparts."

  {
    title: "The Reversed Arrow",
    prompt: "Carved directional arrows have guided you correctly through this dungeon by consistently pointing right at every fork so far. At this final fork, the arrow is carved pointing right as always — but it's been chipped and re-carved at some point, and if you look closely, the original groove beneath the newer carving pointed left.",
    solution: "Someone altered this last arrow, most likely a rival treasure-hunter or the dungeon's original guardians trying to mislead pursuers, covering the true leftward path with a fresh, false rightward carving. The genuine route is left, revealed by the older groove still faintly visible beneath the tampering.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon. This only works as a fair twist if 'follow the right-pointing arrow' has been clearly and repeatedly established at earlier forks, and the tampering here needs to be genuinely visible on a reasonable check, not hidden behind an unfairly high DC. Investigation DC 14 to notice the re-carving and the older groove underneath. Following the false right-pointing arrow leads to a dead end where whoever tampered with the arrow left a trap or an ambush waiting for exactly this mistake — a real, fair fight. Reward: the true left path leads to the dungeon's actual final treasure, appropriately better than a dead end's fight would offer."
  },
  {
    title: "The Reversed Candle Code",
    prompt: "Throughout this dungeon, a blue-burning candle flame has reliably marked the safe path at every fork, while orange flames marked danger — a code the party has used with confidence several times now. In this last hallway, every candle burns blue, and the hallway is a dead end rigged with a trap.",
    solution: "The dungeon's original architect, anticipating that intruders might crack the color code after enough exposure, deliberately reversed it in this one final passage specifically to catch anyone relying on the pattern without further scrutiny — there's no flame-based clue distinguishing safety here, and the party needs another method entirely (checking for a genuinely open passage, testing for drafts, or simply noticing the hallway looks structurally like a dead end) rather than trusting the candles blindly one more time.",
    note: "Use this very sparingly — once, at most, in an entire dungeon, and ideally as a late/climactic twist rather than an early one. It only works if the blue/orange candle code has been firmly and repeatedly established across at least three earlier forks; without heavy prior reinforcement, this reads as pure unfairness rather than a satisfying twist. The trap itself should be a minor, telegraphed setback (a startling noise trap, a minor snare) rather than lethal, since the whole point is to teach a lesson, not punish severely. Reward: recognizing the trick (through Investigation DC 14 on the hallway's structure, independent of the candles) reveals the true path was a side passage overlooked earlier, looping back to unclaimed treasure."
  },
  {
    title: "The Minority Report",
    prompt: "A series of stone plaques line this hall, each bearing a statement — some true, some false, according to a nearby inscription that reads 'Trust the many.' In two earlier rooms, following whichever answer the majority of plaques agreed on was the safe, correct choice. Here, seven of nine plaques agree on one answer, and two disagree.",
    solution: "This room's builders anticipated that intruders would default to 'majority rules' after earlier rooms taught that lesson, so here the seven agreeing plaques are deliberately false (a coordinated deception), while the two dissenting plaques tell the truth. The inscription 'Trust the many' is itself part of the trap, playing on the established habit rather than offering honest guidance.",
    note: "Use sparingly — once per dungeon at most. This only lands as a fair twist if 'the majority answer is correct' has been clearly established across at least two earlier plaque or statement puzzles; otherwise it's an arbitrary coin flip. Insight or Investigation DC 14 to notice subtle tells that the majority plaques share suspiciously identical phrasing or carving style, as if made by the same hand at the same time (a fair, findable clue they're coordinated). Following the majority's false answer triggers a real, if minor, dart trap (DC 13 Dexterity save or 1d6 piercing) rather than harmless smoke. Reward: trusting the honest minority opens the way to a genuine treasure cache, plus the satisfaction of catching the dungeon's cleverest trick."

    prompt: "A squat iron brazier stands in the center of a circular chamber, its coals long dead and cold. Carved into the rim in a dozen languages is the same phrase: 'Warmth for warmth. Give what you will not miss, and I will not open for you.' The only exit is a stone door on the far wall, sealed with no visible mechanism, seams glowing faintly orange when anyone approaches the brazier.",
    solution: "The brazier is keyed to genuine sacrifice, not cleverness. Any character can drop coins into the brazier; the door's glow brightens with the total value thrown in. It unseals permanently once at least 100 gp (adjust to roughly one-third of the party's current gold for their level) has been burned away — the coins visibly blacken and fuse to the brazier's floor, unrecoverable. Tricks like tossing in a single valuable gem and reclaiming it later fail: the brazier evaluates value at the moment of contact and consumes it instantly, leaving nothing behind to retrieve.",
    note: "Hard cost: real party gold, permanently removed from their sheet, no refund and no recovery by any means (identify, dispel magic, etc. do nothing). Set the threshold to something that stings but is affordable — you want groaning, not a TPK-by-poverty. If players try to pay with a Fabricated or Minor Illusion coin, have the brazier's glow simply not respond, making clear it senses real value leaving the party's hands, not the coin's appearance."

An inscription reads: 'Blood remembers what gold forgets. Bleed, and be known.' Nothing else in the room reacts to searching, prying, or spellcraft aimed at the door beyond.",
    solution: "Any creature that presses a hand into the slot and willingly takes damage (a fixed amount — recommend 1d10, or 2d10 for a more dramatic threshold) causes the door to grind open. The damage is real, current hit point loss that can only be healed through normal means afterward — it cannot be shrugged off with resistance or temporary hit points, since the font specifically drains blood, not force.",
    note: "Hard cost: real, current hit point loss (suggest 1d10, non-lethal cap allowed for tension without real death risk) with no in-the-moment recovery — healing spells work afterward as normal, but nothing negates the cost at the font itself. If a player offers an alternative like a self-inflicted cut with a dagger for narrative flavor, allow it and simply apply the same damage roll — reward the roleplay, not a workaround that avoids the cost."

    prompt: "The corridor ends in a shimmering curtain of violet light that hums faintly, clearly a ward keyed against intrusion. A weathered plaque beside it reads: 'Only true magic may unmake me. Cheap tricks will only feed me.' Anyone who steps into the light without countering it takes a jolt of force damage and is shoved back.",
    solution: "The ward can only be unraveled by a spellcaster expending an actual spell slot of 2nd level or higher directed at the curtain (any spell works — the ward consumes the slot's raw magic, not the spell's specific effect). The slot is spent and gone the instant the spell resolves against the curtain, whether or not the caster 'aimed' correctly; the ward simply feeds on the expended magic and dissolves for one minute, long enough for the party to pass through.",
    note: "Hard cost: burning a real spell slot of 2nd level or higher, permanently spent for the day (recoverable only on the caster's next long or short rest, per class), no refund. Cantrips and lower-level slots do not satisfy it — make this explicit if asked. If the party has no spellcasters, allow a scroll or a one-use magic item that expends a charge to work identically, preserving the 'real cost, no trick' spirit."

    title: "The Rustbound Vault",
    prompt: "A vault door is fused shut with corroded iron bands. Etched above it: 'Feed me steel and I will remember how to open.' A narrow slot at hand height is clearly sized to accept a blade or similar tool, and the bands visibly flex when metal is pressed near them.",
    solution: "The vault requires a real weapon or tool made of metal to be fed into the slot and left there — it dissolves the item to fuel the mechanism, and the bands crumble away over the next minute, opening the vault. Any metal weapon or tool of at least minor value works; the vault cannot be fooled by mundane scrap metal that isn't a crafted item (a handful of nails does nothing, but a dagger, a crowbar, or a suit of armor's buckles all work).",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of one metal weapon, tool, or piece of gear, no way to retrieve or repair it afterward. Let players choose which item to sacrifice — reward strategic thinking if they offer up something already broken or low-value, as long as it's a genuine crafted metal item and not a joke substitution."

A spectral weaver's voice, heard only as a whisper on the air, says: 'Give me something that mattered to you, and I will weave you a path.' The loom does not respond to gold, food, or anything offered without genuine personal significance.",
    solution: "The loom is testing sincerity, not value — it wants an item the owning player can describe as personally meaningful (a keepsake, a gift from a mentor, a trophy from an old victory), regardless of gold value. Once such an item is placed on the loom and the player briefly explains its significance aloud, the tapestry completes itself, depicting a hidden passage that then opens in the wall. The item is absorbed into the weave and cannot be recovered.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of a chosen personal item (DM's call on what counts as 'meaningful' — be generous, this is about roleplay investment, not appraised value). If a player tries to bluff sentimental value onto a random inventory item, ask one follow-up question about it; genuine engagement should always be accepted even if invented on the spot."

    solution: "Success requires a caster to maintain concentration on a spell (any concentration spell suffices, cast at the organ) for ten full minutes without it breaking, while the rest of the party fends off the gathering spectral choir, which attacks anyone who isn't the concentrating caster. If concentration breaks even once, the ritual resets and must be started over from a fresh casting.",
    note: "Hard cost: the caster's action economy and spell slot for the full duration, plus real risk to the rest of the party who must hold the line unsupported by that caster's other spells. This is a 'genuinely painful trade-off' puzzle — it removes your best support caster from the fight for ten minutes. If the table wants a workaround, allow a Bard's Song of Rest-style continuous performance (an actual instrument, ten minutes of real playing) to substitute for the spell, provided it's just as costly in attention and vulnerability."

    solution: "The mirror requires a permanently attuned or charged magic item to have one charge (or, for items without charges, a small but real fragment of its power) drawn out and fed into the glass. This is represented as one charge being permanently removed from a wand, staff, or similar item (not recoverable at dawn like normal recharging) — the item's maximum charges are reduced by one, forever. Once fed, the mirror's surface turns to mist and the party may step through into the corridor beyond.",
    note: "Hard cost: a permanent charge (not a daily-recharging one) removed from a magic item, reducing its maximum charges forever — this is a steep, painful cost and should feel like it. If the party has no chargeable item, allow instead the permanent sacrifice of any one magic item's attunement (it becomes permanently non-magical, mundane from then on) as an equally weighty substitute."

    solution: "This is exactly what it appears to be: a flat, non-negotiable toll of a fixed amount of gold per party member to cross the bridge safely. Anyone who tries to cross without paying finds the planks rotten and collapsing beneath them, forcing a Dexterity save or a fall. The beggar cannot be intimidated, charmed, or persuaded below his price — he is bound by an old pact to charge exactly this amount, no more, no less.",
    note: "Hard cost: a fixed gold amount per party member (suggest 25–75 gp depending on party wealth), spent and gone with no refund. This is meant to be one of the easier, lower-tension entries in this category — a clean toll rather than a dilemma. If players try to fight or rob the beggar, the bridge itself becomes hostile (treat as a trap that collapses), making violence strictly worse than paying."

A carved inscription reads: 'Every door you have opened here has cost the shrine something. Now it asks for yours.' The altar seems to specifically recall how many locked doors, traps, or wards the party has already bypassed to reach it.",
    solution: "The altar demands hit points scaled to how many obstacles the party bypassed to reach it (suggest 1d4 per prior obstacle overcome in this dungeon, split however the party chooses among willing participants). Once the damage is taken by however many characters step forward to share the burden, the altar's light flares and reveals a hidden reward or passage. The damage is real and current, not negated by resistances tied to 'sacred' or 'ritual' sources.",
    note: "Hard cost: current hit point loss scaled to dungeon progress (track how many doors/traps/wards were bypassed as you run the level). Let the party choose how to distribute the damage among willing members — this creates a genuine tactical/roleplay decision about who can afford to bleed. No amount of Insight, Arcana, or Religion checks reduces the toll; only paying it opens the way."

A carved warning beside the entrance reads: 'The dark remembers light. Give it yours, and it will let you keep your eyes.'",
    solution: "The passage is roughly 100 feet of true magical darkness that suppresses all light sources, magical and mundane alike, for anyone who enters normally. However, if the party permanently extinguishes and abandons a light source (a torch left burning and sacrificed at the threshold, or a charge of a magical light item spent and never renewed) before entering, the darkness instead reads it as an offering and allows the party through with darkvision-equivalent sight for the crossing, no further light loss.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of a light source — a torch that cannot be relit, or (for the steeper version) a wand of light or similar item's charge that can never be recovered. Without paying, the party can still cross but must do so blind (heavily obscured, no light works), which is its own real cost in time and danger — make sure both paths are viable so the puzzle is a genuine choice, not a wall."

    solution: "A spellcaster who knows spells by selection (Sorcerer, Warlock, Ranger, and similar 'spells known' classes, not classes that prepare from a full list like Wizard or Cleric) may name one spell they currently know. That spell is stricken from their known spells permanently until they would normally have the opportunity to swap a spell known (level up, or a class feature that allows retraining). The book then snaps shut and the passage beyond unlocks.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of a known spell for 'spells known' casters until their next legitimate spell-swap opportunity (which may be levels away) — this is a steep, painful cost, so flag it clearly to the player before they commit. For prepared casters (Wizard, Cleric, Druid), allow the equivalent cost of permanently losing a spell recorded in a spellbook or holy text (torn out and consumed) instead, so every table has a real option. If no caster is willing, the book will also accept the permanent destruction of a spell scroll fed into its pages."

    title: "The Widow's Toll Bridge",
    prompt: "A narrow bridge of black stone crosses a ravine, guarded by a suit of ancient plate armor bolted to the railing. A plaque reads: 'The Widow takes a piece of your protection, not your gold.' The armor's gauntlet is open, palm up, clearly waiting to receive something.",
    solution: "The Widow requires a piece of armor be placed in its gauntlet and left there permanently — a shield, a set of armor, or similar protective gear. Whatever is given is fused into the statue and cannot be reclaimed; the character who gave it suffers a permanent reduction to their Armor Class equal to what that item provided until they acquire a replacement. Once given, the statue steps aside and the bridge is safe to cross.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of an actual piece of armor or shield, reducing the giver's AC until replaced through ordinary means (buying or finding new gear) — no in-dungeon recovery. If the party has no spare armor to give, allow a weapon of at least moderate value to satisfy the Widow instead, at DM discretion, since the spirit of the puzzle is 'give up something that protects you,' not armor specifically."

    title: "The Reliquary of Names",
    prompt: "In a chamber of drifting fog, a robed fey judge with no visible face addresses the party directly: 'I will open the way. In return, you will tell me your true name, and I will keep it. You may go by whatever title you please from then on — but I will always know which one is hollow.'",
    solution: "This is a roleplay-driven cost with a light mechanical tail. The character who gives their true name to the judge suffers disadvantage on Charisma checks made against fey creatures specifically for the rest of the campaign (the judge's kin can always sense the 'hollowness' of a borrowed name), unless a powerful remedy (a wish, a boon from an archfey, or similar high-level magic) restores it. In exchange, the fog parts and the way forward opens immediately.",
    note: "Hard cost: a narrative and mechanical debit (disadvantage on Charisma checks vs. fey) that lingers for the rest of the campaign with no ordinary recovery — treat it as genuinely permanent, reversible only by significant future magic you control as DM. This is a great one to let a roleplay-hungry player opt into for flavor; don't force it on a reluctant table — offer the Beggar King's Toll or another entry as an alternate route if no one wants to pay this particular price."

  {
    title: "The Bone Dial",
    prompt: "A sundial of pale bone sits in an overgrown courtyard, its shadow pointing to numerals that shift and rearrange themselves. Beneath it, carved deep: 'Time opens what time has closed. Give me years, and I will give you the door.' The dial's shadow seems to lean toward whoever reads the inscription aloud.",
    solution: "Touching the dial and accepting its price ages the character permanently by a number of years (suggest 2d10, or a flat 10 for predictability) — this manifests as a genuine, permanent aging effect (as per magical aging effects), not merely cosmetic, with no in-story cure short of a spell like greater restoration or wish. The moment the price is accepted, the courtyard's far door grinds open.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent magical aging (recommend 2d10 years, or scale to taste), curable only by greater restoration or equivalent high-level magic — flag this cost's severity explicitly before the player commits, since it can meaningfully affect long-lived vs. short-lived races differently (a rare fair twist: elves shrug this off far more easily than a human or halfling, which the party may realize and use to their advantage by choosing who touches the dial)."

  {
    title: "The Font of Diamonds",
    prompt: "A small stone basin sits at the base of a statue with its hands cupped, palms up, toward the ceiling. Water drips steadily from the statue's eyes into the basin below. An inscription reads: 'The price of second chances belongs here, not in your pocket.' The basin seems built to hold something small and precious.",
    solution: "The statue requires a diamond worth at least 300 gp (or higher, at DM discretion, to raise the stakes) be placed in the basin, where it dissolves into light and is gone forever. Once given, a hidden mechanism in the statue's base opens, revealing the passage onward. This is deliberately the same value and type of gem used as a material component for spells like Revivify — the puzzle exists to make the party feel the loss of that safety net.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent consumption of a diamond worth 300 gp or more, meaning the party may be knowingly spending their 'emergency resurrection insurance.' Be explicit with the table about this parallel before they commit, since it's the entire point of the puzzle's tension — don't spring the realization on them after the fact as a gotcha. If they have no such diamond, the statue will also accept an equivalent-value gem of any kind, just without the grim resonance."

  {
    title: "The Piper's Toll",
    prompt: "A weathered stone piper stands at a crossroads shrine, his carved flute pointed toward a locked gate. Etched at his feet: 'I will play your song's price. Give me the thing you have bound to yourself, and I will let you pass unbound as well.' The gate's lock has no keyhole — only a smooth indentation the size of a ring or amulet.",
    solution: "The shrine requires a currently attuned magic item to be removed from attunement and placed in the indentation, where it fuses permanently into the statue and cannot be reclaimed by any means. The moment attunement is broken and the item placed, the gate unlocks. This is one of the steepest costs in this list and should be reserved for parties with a magic item they're genuinely willing to part with, or a moment where the DM wants real weight behind a locked door.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of one attuned magic item, no recovery, no substitution with a lesser item (the shrine only responds to something the giver has bound themselves to via attunement). This should be flagged clearly as the most painful entry on this list — consider offering an alternate route around the gate entirely for parties unwilling to pay, so it never becomes a forced wall."

  {
    title: "The Bloodroot Well",
    prompt: "A well of dark, faintly steaming water sits at the center of a moss-choked garden. A ladle hangs beside it on a rusted chain. Words carved into the well's rim read: 'Drink deep of what heals slowly, and the garden will show you its heart.' Nothing else in the garden responds to searching or spellcraft.",
    solution: "Drinking from the well costs the character one Hit Die, spent as though used during a short rest but with no accompanying healing roll — it's simply gone from their pool until their next long rest. The moment the Hit Die is spent this way, the garden's overgrowth parts to reveal a hidden path or object at its heart.",
    note: "Hard cost: one Hit Die spent with no healing benefit, unavailable again until the character's next long rest — a genuinely minor, low-stakes cost meant to give an 'easy call' entry in this category, useful when you want tension without real jeopardy. If a character has no Hit Dice remaining, the well simply will not respond to them, but any other party member can pay in their place."
  },
  {
    title: "The Effigy of Silence",
    prompt: "A hooded effigy sits slumped against a wall, hollow-eyed, in an otherwise empty meditation chamber. A plaque at its feet reads: 'Share my weariness, and I will share what I have seen.' Nothing happens until someone sits beside the effigy and remains still.",
    solution: "A character who sits with the effigy and voluntarily accepts a level of exhaustion is shown a vision (DM's choice — a clue, a map, a warning about what's ahead) and the effigy itself crumbles to dust, leaving behind a small item or key. The exhaustion level is real and persists exactly as the exhaustion rules dictate until removed by rest or magic.",
    note: "Hard cost: one level of exhaustion (per the standard exhaustion track), removed only through normal recovery (a long rest reduces it by one level, or appropriate magic) — meaningful but not devastating, useful as a mid-tier cost. If the party has a character already at a dangerous exhaustion level, let them substitute a different resource cost from elsewhere on this list rather than risk a death spiral; the DM should never let this puzzle be the thing that kills someone outright."
  },
  {
    title: "The Sanctum of Broken Wands",
    prompt: "Shelves of shattered wands line a circular sanctum, and at its center a stone pedestal waits with a groove cut for exactly one item. A voice, ancient and tired, echoes from nowhere: 'Feed the sanctum a working spell, unspent, and it will remember how to open doors.'",
    solution: "The pedestal requires an unused spell scroll to be placed and allowed to burn away completely, unread and uncast — its magic feeds directly into the sanctum's wards rather than being cast normally. The moment a scroll of any level is consumed this way, a section of the wall grinds open to reveal the sanctum's inner vault.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of one spell scroll, consumed without ever getting its effect, no refund. This is a good 'easy call' entry for parties sitting on scrolls they haven't found a use for — but make sure they understand consuming it here means never casting it, which can occasionally still sting if it was something rare."
  },
  {
    title: "The Last Ration Hearth",
    prompt: "A cold hearth dominates an abandoned watchtower room, its stones blackened with old soot. Scratched into the mantle: 'This hearth has not been fed in a hundred years. Feed it what sustains you, and it will remember how to burn.' A basket beside it waits, empty.",
    solution: "The hearth requires the party to place all of their remaining rations (or a specified large portion, such as a full week's worth) into the basket, where they vanish in a puff of gray smoke and the hearth roars to life, illuminating a hidden passage and providing warmth/light for the rest of the dungeon (a minor ongoing benefit as a small consolation).",
    note: "Hard cost: the party's food supply, permanently gone, creating real downstream pressure (forced foraging, hunger rules if you use them, or simply a ticking clock to resupply). This is a good 'slow burn' cost — the pain isn't felt immediately, but several sessions later when supplies run short. Track this cost explicitly on your prep notes so you remember to call it back later."
  },
  {
    title: "The Idol of Open Hands",
    prompt: "A squat golden idol sits at the center of a shrine, its outstretched palms worn smooth from countless offerings over centuries. Faded script at its base reads: 'The idol does not want your gold. It wants your tool.' A dozen small dishes are arranged around it, all empty, all clearly meant to hold something.",
    solution: "The idol responds only to a mundane (non-magical) tool of trade being placed in one of the dishes and left there permanently — thieves' tools, a smith's hammer, a healer's kit, an artisan's instrument, and similar items all qualify. Whatever tool is given crumbles to gold dust, which the idol absorbs, and its eyes flare briefly before a hidden compartment opens elsewhere in the shrine.",
    note: "Hard cost: permanent loss of a mundane tool or kit (thieves' tools, healer's kit, artisan's tools, etc.), no refund, meaning that character loses access to whatever proficiency or utility that tool provided until they buy or find a replacement. This is a moderate cost that specifically targets a party's out-of-combat utility rather than combat power, which is a nice change of pace — let players debate which of their tools they can most afford to lose."
  },
  {
    title: "The Gate of Last Words",
    prompt: "A colossal stone gate is inscribed with hundreds of names in dozens of hands, clearly added over centuries. A final blank space waits at the bottom, along with a stylus of black iron. The inscription above reads: 'Sign here, and the gate remembers you specifically. What it takes from a name, it takes only once — but it always takes something.'",
    solution: "Any character can sign the gate using the stylus, which draws a small but real cost from them at random (roll or choose from this list to suit the moment: 1 permanent point of exhaustion recovery lost this rest, one random cantrip or minor spell forgotten until next level, one point of a chosen ability score reduced until a long rest, or a permanent scar with a minor roleplay consequence). The gate then swings open for the whole party, and that character's name is added permanently to its surface, meaning the gate will always open easily for them in the future (a nice long-term payoff for recurring dungeons).",
    note: "Hard cost: DM's choice from a short menu of minor-but-real costs (see solution), applied once per signer, non-negotiable and non-refundable. Because the exact cost is randomized/DM-chosen rather than known in advance, warn the players clearly that it's a real cost of unknown shape before anyone signs — never spring an unknowable permanent cost on a player without that disclosure."
